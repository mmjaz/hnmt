Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail .
in the course of my speech , I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made .
regarding the first proposal on third @-@ country employees , the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 .
amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too , provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established .
the Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months , as I explained just now .
we also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card &apos; s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States .
in terms of comitology , Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned .
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three @-@ month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned .
in this respect , the Commission supports Amendment No 22 , as I have already mentioned . the other amendments are unacceptable .
personally , I am rather in favour of the term &quot; EU service provision card &quot; which is proposed in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this .
as Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96 / 71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary .
acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued .
surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States .
amendment No 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on Amendment No 10 .
the Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .
as far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term &quot; self @-@ employed &quot; is concerned , the Commission will , as I have already remarked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged .
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood &apos; s remark .
he referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States , and this includes the United Kingdom , are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders .
this applies , as already stated , to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium , where it was recently of relevance .
with regard to the remark made by Mr Karas , I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country .
the Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non @-@ EU countries .
the question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way .
in my opinion , this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate .
on behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .
I will keep myself free in this connection .
finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Berger .
rapporteur . ( FR ) Mr President , we have already had the opportunity , at the first reading , to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House .
life is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget , and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years .
despite the enlargement which has already taken place , when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second , despite enlargement , the level of appropriations remained the same .
and then we see that , increasingly , the regions , the various operators , businesses , associations , are submitting LIFE projects , both for LIFE @-@ NATURE and LIFE @-@ environment , projects that are of excellent quality , which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support , but we still cannot fund them , for lack of budget appropriations .
it must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget .
patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement .
I would stress the LIFE @-@ NATURE strand in particular .
we are well aware that , in the European Union , a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation .
with LIFE @-@ NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility , the validity of the objectives of these directives , and their capacity to be implemented .
and , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop .
and so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues : firstly , comitology , an ongoing debate within this House , but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament .
but we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union &apos; s financial programmes and instruments .
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget .
let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations , not a vast sum in the Community budget , and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus .
I feel , at any rate , that for the ultimate application of LIFE , at least , there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment .
let me conclude with the matter of our institutions &apos; way of working .
this is the essence of how I understand the situation : we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly , that , basically , the Members of Parliament should drop their claims , particularly claims on the budget , for if we do not soon , in line with the codecision procedure , get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE , then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay , and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations .
I would , however , like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date .
as for us , we our bound by the terms of the texts : a maximum of four months .
we meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others , because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time .
I think Parliament often protests about this method , not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council , and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs , since , the truth is , it is something of a tradition , which the Council has kept going for a long time .
but I should like to stress the fact that , on this issue of the environment , the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal .
I therefore hope , firstly , that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other .
Mr President , what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today : an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals ?
we must start by going beyond man , who is not the master of the universe , to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values , without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed .
we need , in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe , to go back to the natural order of the universe , i.e. to the Creation , and beyond that still further , to the Creator &apos; s intention .
then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family , the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens &apos; rights are only respected within sovereign states .
secondly , the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited , as it is today , as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights , thereby denying the legitimacy and , if need be , the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect .
&apos;No freedom for the enemies of freedom &apos; was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago , the advocates of the revolution which proved , alas , to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes .
no human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today , the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles , in international institutions , in the media and cultural networks , and in educational institutions , to mention but a few .
what is left , for example , of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny , if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner , as they were recently by you in Portugal , Mr President of the Council .
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me .
what is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok , one of the most important parties in the Flemish region , if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible , indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals , the Volksunie , which seeks quite simply to abolish the party ?
what is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted , as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal , in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd , arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean @-@ Olivier Viout , the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism ?
it is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism , when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism .
what of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily , as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes , when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues , Mr Le Pen , is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation , in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice , fairness and morals , and when attempts are made , in violation of the clearest legislation , to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote , not received as a favour from the government .
in a word , I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe , fellow Members , when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves .
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem , i.e. Communism .
listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans , in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism , an individualism which , far from allowing people to flourish , paves the way for future dictatorship , in fact the worst kind of dictatorship , because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude .
Madam President , on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it .
for the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy , but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy , in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others , democracy and democratic life .
so , Madam President , maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance .
why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism ?
let us make ourselves heard !
we are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg .
let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words , but a demonstration of our actual political commitment .
Mr President , the President of the Commission will not be surprised if I speak to him about the internal market .
so as not to repeat what has already been said , in particular what has been said by Mr Fiori , who I agree with , I will refer to another central point of the debate , i.e. the reform of the Commission .
what has the reform of the Commission to do with the internal market ?
the answer is a lot .
Mr President of the Commission , on reading your White Paper on the reform of the Commission , it is clearly apparent that the guiding principle , the philosophy behind this reform , is something very vague which we cannot accept in this Parliament .
this guiding principle is mainly the protection of the Community &apos; s financial interests .
that is clearly of concern to all of us , but it is only a starting point .
from there on , the Commission must begin to work , and must fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Treaty .
allow me to give you an example , since the speaking time allotted to me does not give me much opportunity to expand on this idea .
let us consider the intended reform of the infringement procedure .
what is the intention there ?
it is simply to administrate the existing resources on each level , instead of hearing this Parliament &apos; s demand that we should create a genuine administrative procedural law for ensuring legal certainty , which is necessary from the point of view of the European citizen , that is to say , from the point of view of the people who may have recourse to this infringement procedure .
it is simply said that this administrative procedural law will not be created , but rather demands will be selected .
how can this be ?
how can these things be selected in a purely arbitrary way .
from the point of view of this Parliament , this type of arrangement cannot be allowed . we understand that the Commission has to be reformed .
however , it should not lead to the abandonment of the great momentum of European construction , for the sake of protecting the Community &apos; s financial interests , however important we may all agree that that is . the Treaty obliges the Commission , primarily , to provide that momentum .
Mr President , Commissioner , a speaker in this House yesterday expressed the view that economic globalisation is not an incontrovertible necessity but the evil outworking of a few multinationals .
whilst I found this observation quite persuasive , it is , of course , dangerous and misleading because nothing which we are currently doing in Europe in terms of the economy or the environment can be seen in isolation from potential global developments .
and it goes without saying that this also applies to the awarding of an environmental label in the European Union .
take the failed WTO negotiations in Seattle , which have opened our eyes as to the difficulty Europe faces in making itself heard by third countries when it comes to its progressive social and environmental standards .
if we re @-@ commit today to awarding a European environmental label , we must also consider that this will send a clear signal to third countries that it will be present on our products in developing countries and , of course , that others can and will follow suit .
the environmental label must and will signal to third countries a whole range of important environmental concepts : that adverse effects on the environment can be reduced in the manufacture of certain product groups ; that common goals for environmentally friendly consumption should be promoted ; and that the relevant international standards must be observed .
economic globalisation has already made it possible for developing countries to share in the prosperity of rich countries and will continue to do so in the future .
however , one thing must be made clear from the outset , and the common position before us does just that : the same rules must apply for all states .
if the production plants in a country are required to meet the criteria for the environmental label , then this applies to all the production plants where the product in question is manufactured .
if we can achieve this , then we will have globalised an important environmental principle .
Mr President , Commissioner de Palacio , ladies and gentlemen , to summarise today &apos; s debate , there are basically three issues at stake here .
first , the sustainability of energy sources .
secondly , security of supply , which has a quite special effect as far as Europe is concerned , not least because of the unstable political situations in the countries which currently supply energy to Europe .
thirdly , of course , the economy , because energy is a fundamental factor in our international competitiveness and we must therefore ensure that we have an economical supply of energy .
I personally come from Upper Austria and , at present , Upper Austria has broken the energy @-@ saving and energy @-@ renewing records .
where I come from , renewable energy takes top priority , and Upper Austria has an energy savings agency which runs like clockwork .
the principle of subsidiarity applies here and I think that it was this energy savings agency which inaugurated the energy savings fair held a few days ago , thereby meeting the need for education and information for the public as a whole .
I also think that research and development in this area need greater support .
in the final analysis , we should endeavour in Europe to apply the best practice , i.e. to see where there are models - at this energy savings fair in Wels we presented a thick directory of best practice models - and , at the same time , to use benchmarking to show where we have taken the lead in Europe and where progress is being made elsewhere in the world .
I think that this management system is particularly significant for the future of energy supplies in Europe .
the Commission shares the view that its participation in meetings of the Council and all its bodies is part of the EU acquis and an essential element of the European Union institutional framework .
Commission participation is expressly provided for in the Council &apos;s Rules of Procedure , which state that the Commission takes part in all Council meetings , and in meetings of all its preparatory bodies .
only in exceptional circumstances and on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis can the Commission be excluded from these meetings .
in Helsinki , it was confirmed that the development of ESDP should take place within the existing institutional framework .
this reflects the Commission &apos;s full association with the common , foreign and security policy and its shared responsibility with the Council for ensuring consistency in the Union &apos;s external relations .
excluding the Commission from work in this area would be tantamount to accepting the emergence of a fourth pillar in the Treaty , contrary to the Helsinki conclusions .
but although the Commission has a right to attend all working structures in the Council , it does not have an obligation to do so .
there are instances where the Commission decides not to participate in a particular meeting , usually because it considers that the items to be dealt with are not of direct concern to it or to Community affairs .
we have agreed arrangements without difficulty to take part in all the post @-@ Helsinki structures , such as the interim Political and Security Committee , with one exception .
we are still discussing arrangements for the interim military body .
we would plainly have nothing to contribute to the interim military body when it deals with purely military business but there will equally be occasions from time to time when it discusses issues which straddle civil and military cooperation .
in cases like these , I think that it is not only natural but in everyone &apos;s interests that the Commission should participate in the meeting in order to contribute to the overall coherence and effectiveness of European Union policies and actions .
it is a good thing that a system for the identification of bovine animals and the It is right that this should enter into force as soon as possible but not , however , before September given the codecision procedure which is being used .
through this system , consumers can obtain information about the origin of the meat which they buy and the background of the animal can be checked .
due to this improved link between producer and consumer , potential risks to public health can be detected at an early stage and avoided much more effectively .
it is essential that identical labelling rules are applied to beef imported from third countries .
if not all the information required by Community regulations is available , it is vital that a specific label is attached to the product clearly indicating its non @-@ EC origin .
the European Parliament report also proposes , to ensure consumer protection , that operators or organisations producing and marketing minced beef , beef trimmings or cut beef should also be subject to the compulsory labelling system . they should not benefit from the exceptions proposed by the Commission as this would be equivalent to automatically exempting between 30 % and 50 % of beef from the labelling obligation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as the two rapporteurs , Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs Sbarbati , have already explained , both the competent committee and the Committee on Budgets wholeheartedly endorsed the Brenner project , a project that came at the top of the Essen list of priorities .
however , the original project did not set out a list of priorities , a major shortcoming .
I therefore consider it essential for the Commission to accept the points laid down in this report , and which have been explained by the rapporteur , as they stand .
the Brenner Pass covers a region that includes three countries and , as such , it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention .
at present , 1.2 million lorries cross the Brenner Pass every year .
the growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase .
the free movement of persons , one of the freedoms in the European Union , cannot be achieved properly either .
good Friday saw extremely lengthy tailbacks on the Brenner Pass .
we , Mr Jarzembowski , Mr Swoboda and I - as pointed out in the explanatory statement of this motion in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism - tabled a motion in which we justified this initiative as being a means of achieving an innovative model and approach to project development .
it breaks new ground and can set an example to the European Union .
under the Prodi government , the Italian legislature had already considered the possibility of cross @-@ financing road - i.e. road tolls - and rail transport and indeed approved it .
I believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach .
that is an absolute must , especially in an environmentally sensitive area , and I hope the Commission will exhibit the necessary sensitivity .
Mr President , we are going to New York first and foremost to discuss the position of women globally .
naturally , there is a need in the European Union , too , to improve the position of women in all walks of life , but we are now talking more about a worldwide conference .
in my opinion , a worthwhile contribution to this event would be the concept that the empowerment of women can be regarded as a strategy for the development of society as a whole .
by investing in women , we will be helping whole communities and societies on the road to development .
the evidence in support of this is very convincing ; many problems can be overcome by investing , for example , in the primary health care of women .
in the eradication of poverty , supporting women , for example by &apos; micro loans &apos; ( negligible amounts from our point of view ) has proved a very sound strategy for promoting economic activity .
education and training are , of course , the means for women to become members of full standing in society .
I believe that if there is anything we in the European Union can contribute to this conference , it would relate to the fact that we have launched this &apos; gender mainstreaming &apos; process , which entails trying to involve the gender viewpoint in all decision making .
as all those present are well aware , this is not easy - we have a tremendous amount of work to do in this respect ourselves - but we can raise the issue that the role of women needs to be reassessed when it comes to questions of war and peace , for example .
women are , to a very great extent , the victims and those who suffer in wars now .
would it not be a good idea to debate what could be done by women to prevent or resolve these kind of present @-@ day conflicts ?
five years ago , at the Beijing Conference , it was stated that women &apos; s rights are human rights .
we quite agree with the rapporteur , Mrs Smet . we cannot accept what is happening to women in Afghanistan and we must promote the human rights of women at the New York Conference .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say a few words on accidents at sea .
the accident involving the Erika off the French coast is just one of the many accidents which have occurred involving a ship .
it is also often the case that cargo goes overboard .
either way , the marine environment is polluted .
this directive only contributes in a small way towards cross @-@ border cooperation in order to prevent this type of accident .
a far greater contribution would be if a piece of EU legislation governing environmental liability with regard to dangerous cargo were to be laid down .
unfortunately , we still only have a communication and a White Paper , not a bill .
moving on to accidents involving radioactive cargo , it is unfortunate that the Environmental Ministers did not expressly acknowledge this problem and dealt with it accordingly in the common position .
according to European Commission officials , radioactive cargo is implicitly covered in the text .
I would invite Commissioner Wallström to take a stand on this issue , explicitly so .
let us , as a European Parliament , have the courage to include radioactivity explicitly in the text too .
when the Drinking Water Directive was reviewed a couple of years ago , the European Parliament insisted on a tough limit for radioactive substances .
thanks to the European Parliament &apos; s perseverance , this was also included in legislation .
there is a well @-@ known Dutch expression &apos; goed voorbeeld doet goed volgen &apos; &#91; example is better than precept &#93; which captures the above .
Mr President , yesterday we heard Mr Chirac set out his objectives for the French presidency .
in his conclusion he said &quot; Europe will be dynamic if we make it loved by those it serves . &quot;
this is the sweeping rhetoric that occupies the high ground but the detail of the debate today occupies the low ground .
it is precisely this sort of detailed , petty interference that drives the people served by Europe to distraction .
if anything was more calculated to make Europe unloved it is its determination to control every nook and cranny of our lives .
we all , I am sure , have letters saying that these regulations are impracticable , cumbersome , costly and far too complex .
above all , my correspondents tell me that they are fed up with the EU &apos;s mania for bombarding the consumer with information .
soon labels will no longer suffice .
if we keep going at this rate , shopkeepers will have to issue owners &apos; manuals with every pound of minced beef - not , of course , that we are allowed to use pounds any more .
perhaps even MacDonald &apos;s might be forced to protest .
I know from my short experience here that nothing I say and nothing that involves common sense will have the slightest impact because , like a mad elephant out of control , this legislation will crash on regardless .
I will make a prediction .
when this legislation finally goes through we will hear paeans of self @-@ congratulation .
everybody involved will tell themselves how jolly hard they worked .
well , they may be pleased but they certainly will not be loved by the people of Europe .
Mr Chirac is going to be disappointed . the people are despairing .
Mr President , MEDA represents the practical implementation , the instrument of our Euro @-@ Mediterranean policy , as defined following the Barcelona Convention in November 1995 , followed by a number of forums , particularly those in Malta , Naples and Stuttgart .
we are now presenting the first progress report , or annual report for 1998 , but which , in fact , summarises the initial implementation period , 1996 @-@ 1999 , and prepares the way for the implementation of the actions for the second period , 2000 @-@ 2006 , in the form of the regulation proposed by our fellow Member , Mr Valdivielso de Cué .
given that this report is subject to the Hughes Procedure , we have included all the proposals adopted unanimously not only by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , which was chiefly responsible , but also those of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
the context is this : approximately EUR 4 billion over the last four years , plus the considerable appropriations contributed by the EIB , have been allocated .
the Barcelona Agreement signed by 27 countries , those of the European Union plus the 12 countries of the southern Mediterranean : Algeria , Cyprus , Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Malta , Morocco , the Palestinian Authority , Syria , Tunisia and Turkey .
the three main objectives involve the political and security dimension , the economic and financial dimension and the social , cultural and human dimension .
the following observations have been made : this is a programme still in its infancy which has experienced implementation problems and has suffered from various administrative problems , as highlighted by the European Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
there has been particular criticism of sub @-@ contracting associations such as RTM .
in the final analysis , implementation has been virtually paralysed and , despite the almost 100 % commitment of appropriations , only 26 % have been paid to date , and that only with difficulty , with payment taking , on average , four years .
we presented the ins and outs of the matter in sufficient detail in our report , so I am now able simply to summarise our conclusions , which are as follows : firstly , there is a need to simplify the regulation in order to enable the process to be speeded up , while ensuring greater transparency by providing the resources necessary for the Commission to plan the programme and for the Council to monitor it .
above all , the European Parliament must take part in the process and must be kept informed more regularly , particularly through the Euro @-@ Mediterranean forum .
it would be appropriate to speed up the signing of the association agreements , which to date have been signed only with 7 countries .
this particularly concerns Lebanon , Algeria , Syria , etc .
secondly , project selection must be more democratic and must , to a greater extent , involve greater participation by civil society and NGOs , who continually expressed this desire , especially at the European Parliament round table held in Brussels on 29 June this year , entitled &apos; Towards a sustainable MEDA &apos; .
thirdly , respect for human rights must be monitored more carefully , for cooperation is not only targeted at economic progress , but is fundamentally related to democracy , freedom , peace , the eradication of inequality , and sustainable development .
we would therefore ask that a report on the human rights record of each of the signatory or candidate countries be presented to Parliament annually to be taken into consideration in the selection of projects .
fourthly , we consider that the 10 % of appropriations allotted to regional cooperation are inadequate as compared with the 90 % allocated to bilateral cooperation .
we must therefore comment on the volume of appropriations dedicated to regional schemes which , we acknowledge , are harder to negotiate and implement but which correspond to the objective of efficiency , particularly in improving South @-@ South relations and , above all , in safeguarding more extensive action for decentralised cooperation , which we all consider to be an important goal .
fifthly , on the subject of the six priority areas of partnership , the environment , water policy , industry , energy , transport and the information society , we think it essential to reactivate programmes disregarded until now , the SMAP adopted in Helsinki in 1997 on the environment .
at least EUR 10 million must be allocated annually for water .
action must be undertaken to promote renewable energies and to provide support for SMEs and for transport .
we should support each country &apos; s sustainable development plans .
we therefore consider it absolutely essential to implement the proposals for regulations suggested by Mr Valdivielso de Cué , particularly those on simplifying procedures in order to increase the transparency , efficiency and speed of payments and on deploying more Commission staff in order to ensure better administration of the programme , which must cease to be a poor relation in comparison with the cooperation programmes for Asian or ACP countries .
at this point I should like to thank not only the many participants , particularly the countries concerned and the NGOs that helped me to finalise this report , but also our European Commissioner , Mr Patten , who has a clear overview of the situation and whose external relations departments should contribute towards improving Mediterranean projects from now on .
thanks , too , to Mr Patten &apos; s colleagues , especially Mr Patrick Laurent .
I should also like to stress the interest which Commissioner Busquin has taken in our work , reactivating Mediterranean cooperation in the field of research , particularly at the forthcoming informal summit on Capri , on 29 September .
thanks are also due to all our fellow Members of Parliament , particularly Mrs Terrón , Mrs McNally and Mr Sami Naïr who are working on this issue .
it is crucial to implement our proposals in order to achieve the necessary revitalisation of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean process . above all , the appropriations for 2000 @-@ 2006 should not be penalised because of the programme &apos; s earlier problems .
instead the programme must be the spearhead of our policy , which we shall be discussing again at the Marseilles Conference in November .
we wish the French Presidency every success .
I know that they are extremely concerned to resolve all difficulties and determined to achieve their objectives .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for being here today and for your statement .
the Commission appears to be moving quickly towards shaping the European Research Area .
I have two questions : firstly , the term &apos; added value &apos; that you used , although this is not the first time it has been used , refers to economic criteria for the development of research and may lead to the commercialisation of research .
without wishing to pour scorn on the commercial and practical side of the use made of the results of research , I am somewhat concerned that this will become the prime criterion .
could you possibly allay my concern ?
my second question relates to the centres of excellence .
does the Commission have any criteria in mind for choosing these centres of excellence ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am aware of the significance and responsibility of addressing Parliament , which is the sole European body to be directly and democratically elected .
I wish to pay tribute to the strong European spirit of its President and to her resolute determination to make progress in the European political project .
today , working towards Europe means no longer deferring the central issue of government of the Union , and implementing institutional reforms and enlargement . it means realising that the launch of the euro was a turning point in the process of integration .
we are once again deciding the fate of our continent , in a similar way to the great statesmen of the 1950s .
half a century of peace and peaceful and productive coexistence between peoples repeatedly torn asunder by war is testimony to the sense and value of European unification .
yet , as we know , the process is incomplete and , as such , it is not firing on all four cylinders .
Italy is one of the founding countries of the Union and it intends to continue to be an active Member .
this determination is reinforced by a genuine groundswell of opinion which has already manifested itself many times in the Italian parliament in the form of broad consensus in votes on the basic issues of European and security policy .
these very successes provide us with new tasks .
enlargement , which currently demands that we implement radical institutional reforms , is the result of the triumph of a democratic , united Europe following the long confrontation with the Eastern bloc .
the stakes are high , starting with the imminent European Councils in Biarritz and Nice , which must produce a Charter of Fundamental Rights representing all those who are proud to call themselves citizens of Europe and a Union making progress on the path towards integration . the Councils must also instigate closer cooperation to strengthen the Union and introduce more flexibility .
each Member State must shoulder its responsibility for the future of the Union .
the experience of these last 50 years is confirmation of the fact that there is a constant need for a driving force : a non @-@ exclusive vanguard made up of countries which are judged on their merits and which are convinced of the project &apos;s worth and determined to see it through .
institutional reforms , enlargement , management of the economy , defence and a common area of justice are the new struts of a cohesive Union which is ready to take up the challenges presented to it .
the Commission must promote the common interests of the countries of the Union and further the management of the economy .
I would like to congratulate the President of the Commission on his speech and I welcome his authoritative mention , in this Chamber yesterday , of the role , collegial nature and managerial capacity of the Commission .
we have outlined our objectives and the path we must follow to achieve them .
our consistency in implementing what we declare to be our intentions will be measured by the proportion of our goals which we achieve and whether we achieve them on time .
as things stand at the moment , the complexity of the European machinery makes institutional reform absolutely vital .
this is not a new problem .
it was raised when the Community first enlarged to 9 Member States in 1973 , then when it enlarged to 12 in 1986 and during the most recent enlargement in 1995 . it was at the centre of the 1997 Amsterdam European Council due to the evident need to adapt instruments and rules which had been devised for 6 Member States to a Union of 15 Member States , and for a Community which was more limited in its functions and its political aspirations .
we put off dealing with the issue that time around , but we have reached the point where it is now impossible to avoid it .
only as Europe will the individual national states continue to be credible protagonists in the international community .
if the European States were to remain individual countries isolated in the world of globalisation , empty ambition and marginalisation would ensue .
the Union must present a completely united front in matters of foreign policy , defence and common security .
enlargement is essential in ethical as well as political terms : we must provide the candidate countries with exactly the same opportunity to contribute to the great process of European integration that our countries have had in the past , benefiting from the growth of their own democracies and from the security enjoyed by Western Europe .
enlargement requires reinforcement ; reinforcement facilitates enlargement but does not compromise it .
in addition to the countries concerned with enlargement , there is a belt of countries to the east and to the west which are longing to establish firm ties with Europe .
for our own benefit , the Union must project stability and prosperity beyond its present and future borders , with a far @-@ sighted view to forging relationships with both candidate and non @-@ candidate countries alike .
a wider Europe exists which should be attached to the Union , marking a return to the historical soul of a more extensive geographical area .
four hundred and fifty @-@ three days from now , euro notes will enter into circulation .
in a few years &apos; time , national currencies will be nothing but a memory for the new generations .
with the management of the euro centralised in the European System of Central Banks , the new currency has sent the integration process spinning past the point of no return .
the euro is only one stage in the achievement of an economic , social , political and cultural Europe and makes it absolutely essential .
when the decision was taken on monetary union , we were aware that we were creating asymmetry , but we were confident that this would be eliminated in the move towards a common management of the economy .
the concerns generated by the current value of the euro are well @-@ founded , but it must be remembered that all major currencies have , at one time or another , been subject to massive swings in their daily quotation on the markets .
the recovery of the European economy is now taken for granted .
let us exploit the current weakness of the euro , which is producing more competitive prices , to speed up the productivity boom which could be generated by innovation both in instruments and production methods and in the organisation of the markets .
ladies and gentlemen , the debate embarked upon with regard to the European Constitution is an indication of vibrancy and confidence in European ideals and an awareness of a genuine community of values .
one must be both realistic and idealistic in affirming an idea .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights was drawn up in response to the need to insert Europe into the consciousness of civil society ; it is proof of the fact that European integration is not an artificial construction but one with a soul : European identity .
the European Charter makes clear to the world and , even more importantly , ourselves , who we are and what we believe .
if we do not make this clear now , in this sensitive , turbulent passage of European and world history , when will we be able to ?
the scope of our community of values is more clearly defined and more advanced than we ourselves are sometimes wont to believe .
the debate to which each country contributes with its unique sensitivity , traditions and culture is a medium for teasing them out , defining and affirming them .
with the Charter of Fundamental Rights , Europe is taking a significant step forwards in the transformation of an area which has hitherto been predominantly economic into a common area of rights , by establishing values and rules which define the concept of European citizenship .
it is important that , once the Charter has been endorsed by the European Council , it is published for the citizens to read so that they recognise their own European identity in its content .
a connection will then have to be established between the Charter and the revised Treaties .
this can be achieved in several different ways : by inserting the Charter into the new legal corpus or by attaching it as the preamble .
personally , I feel that the Charter should form the first part of a Constitution ,
( applause ) the second part of which should be dedicated to defining the different institutions , their responsibilities and the relationships between them .
the problem of whether Europe should be structured along federal or confederal lines is in danger of steering us off course .
now is the time to identify and tease out the elements of convergence and to proceed pragmatically rather than according to a set plan .
the determination of the European people to reform must be met with solutions which will allow federal institutions such as the European Central Bank to work together with other institutions that are organised on the basis of an intergovernmental model .
ladies and gentlemen , the image and role of Europe and the individual European States in the world of the twenty @-@ first century depend on the outcome of the forthcoming meetings of the European Council .
the Americas , the Pacific and Asia are using the European Union as a model and interlocutor in the processes of regional integration .
time is not on our side in this respect either , for we are not the sole pace @-@ setters of the European unitary process .
the extra dimension which we can only exploit as a Union becomes vital if we are to keep up with the other great leading players on the international scene .
two vitally important regions directly concern Europe : the Balkans and the Mediterranean .
the political message to the Balkans has been and must remain quite clear : violence and ethnic sectarianism do not pay ; what has happened there is unacceptable .
the consolidation of the values of democracy and human rights cannot be put on hold .
( applause ) The recent elections in Yugoslavia have shown the intensity of the Yugoslav people &apos;s desire for freedom and of their democratic determination to bring about change .
we must ensure that , in the European competition to rebuild the economy of the Balkans , words are systematically followed by actions .
lastly , we must provide the countries and peoples of South @-@ East Europe with the hope that they will be able to penetrate the institutional bounds of the Union .
in the Mediterranean , there is still no true sense of a European presence and the role of the Union .
and yet Europe is part of the Mediterranean !
( applause ) The Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership is not sufficient in its current form .
we need to turn it into a driving force for cooperation in interdependence , an interdependence which is illustrated clearly by the surge in oil prices .
we need a decision @-@ making forum in order to address issues which are of primary importance to both sides of the Mediterranean , such as migration flows , the transfer of the factors of production and energy supply .
above all , we must believe in Europe &apos;s vocation in the Mediterranean .
the outbreak of violence during the last few days in the West Bank , Jerusalem and Gaza is deeply distressing .
it is the result of the exasperatingly slow pace of the negotiating process .
what has happened is confirmation of the fact that the only alternative to peace is a war which would entail intolerable loss of human life .
the entire civilised world is calling for an end to all acts of violence , a return to normal and the reopening of negotiations .
Europe must play an active role in this .
( applause ) Europe has a unique cultural , social , legal and scientific heritage ; it is nourished by the variety and vitality of its national components .
due to its uniqueness , Europe has nothing to fear from any other cultural entity : its light only fades when its historical and cultural identity grows faint , when we behave as if our civilisation is only held together by economic and commercial ties .
the United Nations Millennium Summit closed with the identification of the great world @-@ wide issues in which the international community is called to intervene in the interests of the whole of humanity : freedom , equality , solidarity , tolerance , respect for nature and sharing of responsibility .
how could Europe fail to play a leading role in each of these areas ?
against the backdrop of the many centuries of our continent &apos;s history , the idea of Europe was translated in a relatively short space of time from a utopian ideal into agreements , institutions , into a community and now into a Union .
anyone who has lived through our times and looks back sees that there is peace where there used to be war , the spread of unprecedented prosperity and the growth of open , democratic societies which mutually support each other .
when I think of Europe today , I associate it with national interest for I can see the immeasurable benefits which Italy and other Member States have derived from the success of European integration .
as an Italian citizen and as President of the Italian Republic , I have never tried to hide my pro @-@ European convictions .
they in no way detract from the love which I feel for my country , which I have been serving for sixty years , and they are not incompatible with either my , or your , justifiable national pride .
the Europe I believe in is not a negation , but a celebration of our national societies and their values .
( applause ) I would like to illustrate this sentiment with a quotation from the works of a great European and a great French writer , Charles Secondat de Montesquieu : &apos; ... if I had known something useful for my family that was not so for my nation , I would have sought to forget it ; if I had known something useful for my country that would have been prejudicial for Europe , or which would have been useful to Europe but prejudicial for the human race , I would have rejected it as a crime . &apos;
ladies and gentlemen , the future we share begins here , in this Chamber .
being a Member of the European Parliament means considering the future and the inheritance which we wish to leave the new generations of our countries , of our entire continent .
being a Member of the European Parliament means contributing to the creation and consolidation of institutions which represent the best possible guarantee of stability , peaceful coexistence and prosperity .
in the space of half a century , the Union has changed the face of Europe and transformed relations between our peoples .
the elimination of armed conflict from European life is in itself an epic victory . it is so very complete a victory that we are starting to take it for granted .
we have reached the point where two whole generations know only this Europe , a Europe of interdependence and open borders .
as guardian and interpreter of the victories that have been won , the European Parliament is an active guarantee that the great changes which have been undertaken will be accomplished .
the timetable we have set ourselves requires great cooperation between all the institutions .
the exacting work carried out by the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission must , in the interests of the Union , interact with Member States &apos; initiatives .
we must not be discouraged by the scale of the undertaking .
we need determination , resoluteness and political will in following a path which has already been mapped out .
at Biarritz and Nice , we have no choice but to tackle the Charter of Fundamental Rights and an institutional reform which can be put off no longer .
2002 will be the turning point for the euro , when , in addition to being an accounting currency , it will become a tangible banknote in the wallets of all European citizens .
subsequently , with the entry into force of the Treaty reforming the institutions , the Union will be in a position to manage the new , more substantial and more weighty responsibilities for which it is currently preparing : welcoming the first new Members to join , consolidating the common foreign policy , creating a common military force , implementing once and for all the area of freedom , security and justice and adopting the fundamental Charter of the European Union .
none of us can claim to know , here and now , exactly when and in what order we will achieve these goals , but we do all know that , if we firmly believe in and desire these things , then we will already be halfway to success .
the very content of the project and the international context in which we are acting mean that we must advance coherently , for the eyes of the world will be on us : countries and citizens are free to make their choices at each stage , but European integration can neither be delayed nor slowed down .
long live the European Parliament !
long live the European Union !
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , all of us here agree that equal opportunities for men and women must be pursued in all our policies .
but beyond that , the method has to be defined .
we need to be sure that what is decided in Strasbourg is real progress .
in the name of equal opportunities , and thanks to Europe , French women have won the right to work at night .
I am not sure they should thank Europe for that .
the European method , imposing uniformity , is wrong .
first , because while women , like citizens in general , have the same ideas of what is fair and what is unjust , they do not have the same ideas about their role in the various cultures of the European Union .
nature has determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb .
now , the primary duty of any society is to promote life and hence do everything possible to enable women to reconcile their legitimate right to personal and professional development with potential motherhood .
in that area , there is no equality .
only women can have children .
so fairness does not come into the equation when the roles of women and men are as different as that .
rather than making abortion easier , the French government should be developing a policy aimed at eliminating every material and social reason which might drive a woman to such a negation of life .
every abortion is a condemnation of our society , but never a condemnation of an individual woman .
since I became a Member of this Parliament , however , it has been my impression that a part of this House would rather forget this aspect of women &apos; s lives .
more serious still , I also have the feeling that the institutions of the European Union have the greatest difficulty developing a global vision of society in our countries .
as the debates and regulations go by , a compartmentalised vision of our society appears .
instead of addressing everyone , we compartmentalise : minority after minority , ethnic group after ethnic group .
as a French woman and citizen , this vision of the world is particularly alien to me .
I am a citizen who should enjoy the same rights and the same prospects as any citizen of the other sex , no more and no less .
I do smile sometimes in this House , particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency are women , especially in Denmark .
when we decide on policies targeting people with disabilities , or blind people , it is perfectly normal to add women .
it is really very annoying that these women , from the depths of their kitchens or household accounts , are rejecting the radiant future of the euro .
they must be re @-@ educated .
the image of the European woman we find in the pages of our reports and directives does not correspond to that of these Danish women , the majority of whom are saying no to the euro .
so , new pages describe her as ill informed , isolated , and out of step with everyone else .
Danish women will appreciate that .
I take this opportunity to salute the Danish women Members of Parliament , especially Ulla Sandbaek and Pia Kjaersgaard . they come from different political backgrounds , but together they embody the courage so many men lack .
it is my conviction that a method is being outlined today through policies geared to sectors , not to say minorities , in this Parliament .
any kind of national attachment must be destroyed , European societies must be reduced to a collection of isolated individuals in small ethnic , sexual , social or other minorities , all run from a distance by a European State as distant as it is pernickety .
it is not surprising , therefore , that Mrs Dybkjær &apos; s report refers to the Beijing Platform , which uses women &apos; s rights as a weapon to defend a particular conception of women and their rights , and impose it on the whole world .
the Polish delegation to the New York conference already had occasion to appreciate the arrogance of a part of the European delegation incapable of accepting other positions more measured than its own .
other Members of this Parliament had to take up the pen to put things right , and Poland thanked them for it .
in spite of these remarks , we shall vote for this report because we are naturally in favour of equal opportunities , but what equal opportunities means most of all is respect for everyone .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my group proposes to support the present motion , which we have also signed , because I believe it is right for the European Union to support the solution that has been found in Macedonia and which accommodates the Albanian population .
I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the parties in Parliament could have voted for .
we would rather leave it to the Macedonians to discuss where the process broke down , Mrs Pack .
I have it on good authority that they were only trivial issues , and that the government could have accommodated the opposition in this respect .
I do not know .
I do not think that is the be @-@ all and end @-@ all .
what matters most is that a solution is found which we can all subscribe to .
even though this notion is unpopular in this House - indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit , the more divided the systems , and the more separatist the movements , the better - I would like to make the point here , which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterparts from Macedonia , that we must be clear about the fact that their own Albanian @-@ language institutions should help to promote social cohesion in Macedonia and not create divisions .
that is an important aspect we should not lose sight of .
Madam President , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , having deliberated at its sitting of 15 and 16 May , agreed to recommend that the announcement in plenary of Parliament &apos; s confirmation of the removal of Mr Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen &apos; s mandate be suspended .
I repeat , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market recommended that this announcement be suspended until the deadline period that Mr Le Pen was given for appealing against the French Council of State had expired or until a decision by the latter .
and I am quoting word for word from the letter dated 17 May that you yourself , Madam President , read in plenary .
as you said , the Council of State rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection .
there is therefore no longer any reason for delaying this announcement in plenary , which is an obligatory act according to primary law , specifically paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the Act of 20 September 1976 .
the request for a reprieve that you mentioned , Madam President , does not alter this situation , as it is not a legal appeal .
as its name indicates , it is an act of the Prince , which does not affect the decree from the French Government which , in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , must be announced in plenary .
Mr President , the action plan states in its analysis that the status quo in Albania is worrying .
the poor social , economic and political conditions combined with a lack of or insufficient legal certainty and organised crime are causing migration on a huge scale .
Albania is a significant country of transit and origin for immigration into the European Union .
on the other hand , positive efforts are being made to drive forward the democratisation process and to develop society , which we must and will support .
restricting the number of immigrants coming into the EU from and through Albania is the main aim of the action plan .
to achieve this , measures are needed which work in two different directions .
firstly , the positive forces in Albania need to be supported ; secondly , legal instruments need to be created for immigration from this region , which restrict or stop illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings , as well as the diverse forms of crime associated with them such as illicit employment and prostitution .
we need preventative measures specially tailored to Albania , which will provide support for building or rebuilding the country so as to enable people to live in dignity in the region .
many reasons for emigrating , seeking asylum and taking flight would thus cease to exist .
but what we need on the other hand are stringent , uniform legal instruments for immigration in the whole of the European Union .
these legal instruments cannot , however , include provisions to legalise criminal actions .
gangs of smugglers do not provide a service , generously rescuing people from persecution by totalitarian states .
paid traffickers , most of whom are involved in large @-@ scale , cross @-@ border organised crime , make cruel profits out of the misfortune and hopes of the people concerned and do not provide magnanimous humanitarian services .
in this context , the proposal tabled by Mrs Schröder , to make EU aid available to the traffickers , must also be condemned as counterproductive and contemptuous of human life .
you , Mrs Karamanou , are certainly right because the traffickers are not the root of the evil .
but the root of the evil is not the European Union either .
the root of the evil are the conditions in the countries of origin .
I welcome the action plan , but I cannot support what Mrs Karamanou says in her report because she does not describe the illegal crossing of borders as a criminal act and therefore says that it is legal .
for us to tackle the causes , however , and not continue just to fight against the symptoms , we need to provide help in the regions concerned and we need to resolve the whole issue of immigration , asylum and war refugees in the European Union by coming up with solutions which do justice to the immigrants but also to the host countries .
Mr President , Vice @-@ President of the Commission , in the past , Parliament has continually demonstrated its commitment to the harmonisation of safety standards at the highest possible level for the Union .
now it must continue to do so , and to ensure , as a matter of urgency , that this is clearly visible to the European citizens , who every year continue to suffer the problems of the European area .
we all agree that the objective is to successfully do away with national discrepancies in order to arrive at a set of common safety standards at the highest possible level .
air safety cannot be confined to European Union territory , and it is important for European citizens who travel or live near airports to be confident that aircraft from third countries fulfil all the necessary safety criteria .
the Union must therefore have control methods to ensure that , in accordance with international regulations , third country aircraft arriving at our airports comply with international safety regulations .
this means common control methods and technical and administrative organisation and support .
it is therefore inevitable that safety in this sector should become a matter for international cooperation within the framework of the different instruments for technical assistance and support for investment in third countries .
Mr President , I will end by pointing out the need to assist the Commission in its work in this very complicated field and the priority which must be given to creating the European Air Safety Agency , as well as the need for independent regulations , which we are currently considering , on issues relating to rest periods for aircrew .
Mr President , of course I entirely agree with Mr Schulz &apos;s last point , but I should like this once to state quite clearly that , now that the Friday sitting has been abolished , there is a systematic campaign to abolish the Thursday sitting too .
on the other hand , the responses to this are far from systematic .
on Monday , Mr Seppänen said that his report was too important to be taken on Thursday evening .
nevertheless , following Mr Seppänen &apos;s speech , this House made a democratic decision to take his report on Thursday evening .
then at midday on Wednesday , the President of the sitting explained that with the agreement of the groups Mr Seppänen &apos;s report would be moved to Thursday morning .
this morning we were presented with an agenda , out of which it emerged that the Ferri and Deprez reports would be dealt with this evening .
this morning nobody protested against this .
at lunchtime Mr Ferri realised that he would be leaving and asked for his report to be postponed .
his request was granted , and Mr Deprez sat there and did not protest .
this afternoon Mr Deprez realised that his speakers had gone astray and now this evening he wants his report to be postponed .
this is looking increasingly like a Punch and Judy show , I really do have to say .
I should like very clearly to oppose this postponement .
Mr Schulz , Mrs Boumediene @-@ Thiery and I are Members of this committee .
we can air our views on this issue , and we should go ahead with the debate .
however , I would hope that proceedings could be more orderly in the future .
Madam President , when , at your instigation , I left the Chamber of the European Parliament in Strasbourg , I paraphrased General MacArthur &apos; s famous saying , when forced out of the Philippines by the enemy , &quot; I will come back . &quot;
like him , having returned , I can today say , &quot; I am back ! &quot;
the Court of Justice has indeed reinstated me as a legitimate Member of the European Parliament , acknowledging the sound basis of my defence .
indeed , the House must be aware that , on the pretext of a trivial incident occurring during the election campaign , the Socialist @-@ Communist Government elected several days later has , for three years , flouting all legal principles , conducted a veritable witch hunt against me with a view to ridding themselves of a political adversary in Parliament , even though I had the mandate of millions of voters .
it is , I believe , this fumus persecutionis , in combination with the violations of the law and of parliamentary immunity , primarily , which led the Court to make its ruling .
I am certain that all democrats will rejoice at this principled and just decision .
Mr President , on 8 November the Commission adopted the reports for the year 2000 on the progress made towards accession by each of the 15 countries .
it considered that all of them , with only the exception of Turkey , were observing the political criteria set in Copenhagen .
despite that , a fortnight afterwards , Turkey attended for the first time the fourth conference on the European Union social funds .
during the summit in Nice , Turkey promised that the new F @-@ type prisons where physical and psychological torture exist would no longer be used .
we all ought to read the report of the human rights mission from 26 December until New Year &apos;s Eve .
this report has been presented in Brussels and shows the desperate situation of hundreds of prisoners in Turkish prisons , in particular those of Kurdish origin .
Article 4 of the proposal dealt with by Mr Swoboda should be implemented immediately .
we do not need to go any further .
this must be stopped right now .
otherwise , is this the right way to guarantee the promotion of Kurdish identity ?
as Mr Brie has pointed out , reality contradicts us .
Madam President , I am going to respond to the first two questions because they relate to an extremely topical issue of very wide general interest .
to return to the question of demoralisation among staff : clearly , we have created a sense of insecurity this year .
I am aware of that : it has been a difficult task but we could not do things any differently , for we have had to go right back to grass roots and review every job description , the fundamental objectives and also the issue of multiculturality .
so why is it that this reform is so problematic ?
because we cannot be content to copy or imitate blindly any of the national administrations : either we succeed in the ground @-@ breaking experiment of combining the different traditions and cultures to create a single tradition and a single culture , or we will have failed in our task .
obviously , we could not - we cannot - accomplish such a process without going right back to grass roots and starting completely afresh .
I am quite aware that this has caused concern and I take full responsibility , but there was no other option .
even today , our debate starts with an open proposal , a proposal that is not limited to points to adopt or reject but which is the starting point for a discussion - moreover part of our tradition - that will , in the future , become part of a tradition of public administration which is different from that of any individual country .
well then , we are still a long way from completing this reform - it will take the whole of the forthcoming year to implement it - but , as Commissioner Kinnock said just now , we should have completed the dialogue process , this process by which , together with the trade unions and staff , we are to establish our strategy , before July .
we plan to have the definitive reference framework ready within the next few months , before the summer , the following stage then being to implement the individual chapters .
Mr President , Commissioner , the supplementary budget per se and the EUR 971 million are not the problem .
they are simply part of normal business and we should not be perturbed by the amount of money involved .
the real question is what it is used for and why it is necessary .
and I say that if the European Parliament had had codecision rights in respect of Agenda 2000 , a different decision would have been taken in Berlin .
for example , we would have meadows instead of maize , we would have suspended intervention , all of which was proposed by the Commission and by Parliament .
we would have linkage with the working costs , we would have the 1990s threshold , which applies in conjunction with the working costs .
we would have adopted all these measures which are now back on the agenda , and , Mr Böge , we would then have something which we genuinely could call Agenda 2000 and progress .
but now , under your influence , in which I also include COPA and the broad spectrum of the Christian Democrats , it is precisely these reforms which have been blocked .
that is the major problem : we are having to address this issue again today and spend money on a policy which has gone in quite the wrong direction .
if we take Mr Fischler &apos;s proposals , it is the destruction , not the slaughtering , which is the problem .
we in Europe will then feature in pictures all over the world which show the slaughtering campaigns and destruction .
from a cultural point of view , and in terms of Europe &apos;s cultural claim , we cannot sustain that for very long .
it would undoubtedly be sensible , Mrs Haug , to agree on the slaughtering of young cattle and calves in this context .
it is not a matter of a &apos; Herod premium &apos; , but of ensuring that these new @-@ born calves do not develop into massive bulls , but go on the market , after the appropriate tests and removal of any unsafe material , as quality meat .
that was Mrs Schreyer &apos;s proposal .
I regret that the proposal did not come from Mr Fischler and I hope that we will be able to follow that up later when we discuss his 7 @-@ point plan .
in other words , it depends on how we spend the money .
as the budget spokesman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has pointed out , we have often reimbursed money in the past .
but that is not the problem : the key issue is whether there will be enough money left over to set a new course in our agricultural policy .
I can see the following danger : if we pay for the special measures required to deal with this crisis out of the normal budget , then when we do want to set a new course , the funds will no longer be available .
so I think it is quite acceptable for the Member States and the EU to cover the costs here as well .
I would like those responsible for this crisis - who are not found in the political arena but in the private sphere - to pay into a compensation fund for those who have been affected , i.e. the farmers and those who have suffered human tragedy , as is the case in Great Britain ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , President of the Commission , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I entreat all of you : let us stop talking about the follow @-@ up to Nice and talk instead about the future .
let us look towards the future . I would also like to correct an oversight this morning .
before we look to the future let us wind up the past . let us invite the Member States to ratify Nice as soon as possible .
this is essential if we want to clear the air for the debate .
as I look towards the future I am convinced about one thing . the leap forward we are expecting will come from public opinion , from the debate , but first and foremost from young people .
it is to them that the Europe of the future belongs . it is not enough , however , to say : the debate , the debate , the debate .
you are right , Commissioner : we must organise it and structure it .
to guide this debate , I think that at some point we must ask ourselves about the usefulness of a questionnaire .
by the same token , we must use all the available forums for this debate , while being aware that none of them , be it national conferences , consultations with unions , forums of civil societies , will have the power to arrive at a conclusion .
for , pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty , the conclusion belongs to the Heads of State and Government .
let us take note of this . between these two stages , though , what will revive hope within Europe is nevertheless the adventure of the convention , which is no longer that adventurous .
the experience of the Charter demonstrated this .
I believe it was Mr Poettering who asked a question about a parallel process between the public debate and the convention .
it seems to us that the correct formula is that of a broad , open debate , which will take place as soon as possible . when the convention starts its work , the debate will continue in parallel in order to draw the necessary lessons from the experience of the convention .
and then this Parliament will agree to consult all the wise men on earth and to participate in all the forums . in the final analysis , however , it is the representatives of democracy who will have to participate in this convention .
one last word , Mr President . the Council was courageous enough to invent the convention .
we ask it to show the same courage and look to the future with confidence . our citizens expect this .
our fellow Member , Claude Desama , has invited us to take part in constructing a new federalism and we should accept this invitation .
Mr President , my Group backs the rapporteur , who has clearly illustrated that the convergence and stability programmes are extremely valuable when it comes to forging real economic policy in the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular which is a matter of common interest .
we see the outlines of economic policy on the one hand , but we see the stability and convergence programmes on the other .
I should also like to remind the House in this context that the Stability and Growth Pact has predominantly been geared in the past towards achieving stability .
it did , however , always include growth factors .
from this point of view , the rapporteur &apos; s approach is the right one , indicating as it does that it makes sense to use investments , both private and public , in order to achieve a real knowledge @-@ based society of the future in the European Union .
if these public @-@ sector investments are used for the benefit of information technologies , other new technologies and a better , modernised infrastructure in the euro zone and the European Union , then this is the right way forward .
from this point of view it is also very important that we restart the debate on the quality of public finances .
luckily , the Commission has presented a paper here which will need to play an important part in future discussions in connection with stability and convergence programmes .
because we must ensure when evaluating the state of public finances , which is also our job , when analysing the content of the convergence and stability programmes , that we identify the right trend , that we identify the right development , but that we do not lose sight during our discussions of the possibility of steering in the opposite direction .
Mr von Wogau , you referred to possible dangers .
you pointed out that advice in the Bible on lean and fat years should still be seen as relevant by financial policy @-@ makers in the European Union .
any analysis of public finances , however , must also consider what impact expenditure may have on monetary policy .
we therefore need to work with sound public finances in the euro zone because a poor financial situation could jeopardise monetary stability .
windfalls have not been spent on consumption as in past years ; they have also been used to reduce debt and for investments .
we must also consider how this sort of economic policy coordination can be used to guarantee social and employment policy as well as monetary stability .
here too there is both an obligation and a challenge for the countries in the euro zone , the pre @-@ ins and future candidate countries alike .
it gives me great pleasure to present this report to the House on behalf of the Industry Committee .
this is an own @-@ initiative report by the Industry Committee and therefore it is a privilege to work on what are a relatively select number of these reports and to be the custodian on behalf of my committee .
I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the colleagues who have contributed to this report and those who helped me in industry and in the Commission to make sure that we covered the ground thoroughly .
I was pleased that the final report reflected all those contributions and was adopted unanimously by the committee .
I hope that it will get the same level of support from the House today .
this report sends a strong political signal to the Commission and Council that this Parliament wants this crucial area - the evolution of the Next Generation of Internet and electronic communication - to be reflected in the crucial decisions on research support that are about to made in the context of the Framework Six Programme .
I know that a number of colleagues who will contribute here today are also actively involved in this programme .
I would like to address the three key questions that I tried to answer in my report : why is this so important ?
why do we use the word initiative in presenting this to you ?
what do we want to look at and how are we going to achieve it ?
first I think the strategic importance of electronic communications and the Internet are increasingly well understood by everyone in this House .
but what is the contribution for Commission and publicly @-@ funded research ?
this report argues that there is a strong case for supporting pre @-@ competitive work in the next stages of the evolution of this technology and that pre @-@ competitive work will underlie the future competitiveness of all the industries and service providers who are engaged in this crucial business , and governments as well .
with the adoption of the GSM standard in mobile telecommunications , we have seen how important pre @-@ competitive work is in setting in place the standards , protocols , and architecture for the next and evolving stage of communications .
it is clear why we should do it but what do we need to do in that context ?
we need to anticipate the technologies that will be needed in a world where the capacity of the whole distribution system for electronic communications is going to be far larger than it is today .
that investment is going in now and will continue to go in , so we should plan for a world with a very large amount of bandwidth capacity : that is the jargon we would use for saying the carrying @-@ capacity of the wires or the airwaves that are communicating users to users and users with service suppliers .
the architecture that we should develop will be very different from the architecture we have today where carrying @-@ capacity is constrained .
one of the core areas proposed in this report is to ensure that we use the research network that the Commission is already funding - the Géant network - to use that effectively by supporting projects that will exploit that very high carrying @-@ capacity research network in anticipation of the whole infrastructure evolution that in future will be driven by the market place .
that is the core of the system architecture , but alongside that there are other public policy areas where we want to do research .
issues of security and data protection are clearly important .
they are becoming more and more important as our personal data are so easily and quickly circulated .
it is also becoming more important because , in the wireless connected world , we will increasingly have more devices feeding information about ourselves , houses and cars into the system .
there will be a new type of personal data that is being used in a benign way to monitor the operation of our car and the security systems in our house , but if somebody could accumulate and collect that data it would be a far from benign use of it .
data protection therefore needs to be thought of differently , encapsulating data together so it cannot be amalgamated in an unauthorised way .
we need to think about the new opportunities afforded by wireless technologies , how the amount of information carried in our personal devices or mobile phones can be used in commercial transactions , but also about carrying our health records around with us in case of emergency and about areas where highly confidential data will be distributed .
we also need to think about the new products that will allow wireless technology to carry things like video broadcasts , access to streamed broadcasts that could be passing through and around us : how , for example , could we access our local television station wherever we are in the world , and how would we pay for that ?
that technology is something that will give us a real competitive advantage .
I have just sketched out the &apos; what &apos; areas of my three questions , so let me conclude by saying &apos; how &apos; we would like to move this forward .
this is a contribution to the debate on research policy in Framework Six Programme and our vote today will enable that to move at exactly the right time into the ongoing strategic discussion process .
we need to ask the Commission , in taking this forward , to look at building a network of excellence around these technologies .
although this is one of the areas contained in the Commission &apos;s plans , it is clearly a priority for this particular field of technology .
we are also looking for the sort of integrated projects involving the public and private sector that the Commission envisages in its proposal .
in conclusion , I warmly commend this report to the House today and I would just emphasise again the importance that Parliament attaches to ensuring that the Commission takes this forward in its future strategies .
Madam President , with your permission , I rise for the first time here in connection with the Rules of Procedure .
I wish to propose that we include a debate on the impact of the referendum in Ireland as a separate agenda item .
in my view , the referendum in Ireland offers this House the unique opportunity to shape democracy and intervene immediately in the current debate , rather than always following after the event .
Nice resulted in too little democracy and failed to create a sound basis for enlargement . we need more than this now , and with the help of the Irish people , we can re @-@ open this debate .
this is the reason for this motion to amend the agenda : we move that a separate agenda item be included to debate the impact of Nice , our positions as parliamentarians with regard to our own willingness to create more democracy in Europe , and the finality of Europe .
Europe &apos;s citizens would not understand if we shirked this issue at this time .
Mr President , Commissioner , a strong Authority that can avail itself of all the wealth of Europe &apos; s experience , ability and professionalism : if that is the accepted and agreed principle underlying the European Food Authority , the principle of separation between risk assessment and risk management is not , in my opinion , likely to apply very much , in terms of either timing or purpose .
from this angle , the establishment of a European Food Authority represents the base line , the first step towards bringing protection up to speed and responding to consumers &apos; demands and also their fears .
to make that concrete , the European Food Authority &apos; s operations and mission must cover real detailed knowledge of all the farms scattered across the European Union .
hence a close and positive link with appropriate structures inside the countries of the Union seems essential and fundamental .
furthermore , it is becoming hard to believe that animal health is in any way remote or separate from public health generally . animal health is therefore a vital issue , but so are healthy vegetables , genetically modified organisms and , last but not least , labelling .
in my opinion , it is precisely through the action of the European Food Authority that the European concept of traceability must become reality , and a thread running through every link in the food chain : production , industrial processing and marketing .
if we fail to impose this traceability in the service of the citizen , we will inevitably lose a great opportunity for transparency and political action to demonstrate that we are indeed responsive to the demands of our fellow European citizens .
thank you , Mrs Terrón i Cusí .
with regard to the absence of the Council , you already know - I do not know if it is coincidental that it happens under my Presidency - that the Council is profoundly allergic to debates and votes on issues relating to freedoms .
it is an illness that recurs on a regular basis .
with regard to Mr Pirker &apos; s comment , I believe that his protest is absolutely justifiable and the Presidency will pass it on to the Council in the correct manner .

( Parliament adopted the resolution )
explanations OF VOTE- Whitehead report ( A5 @-@ 0198 / 2001 )
, rapporteur .
( DE ) Mr President , if we had held this debate on the oil supply of the European Union six months ago , far more attention would probably have been paid to it and a host of journalists would have been here so that they could report on it the following day .
I doubt if this will be the case today because things have calmed down somewhat since .
surprisingly , back then , when oil prices were indeed rising , albeit not so dramatically , the streets were full of protesters and if a country had held elections , the government would probably have had terrible trouble getting re @-@ elected ; even though there is nothing they can do about it , psychologically it makes a huge difference .
people were confused and many took to the streets in anger .
what exactly is my point here ?
my point is that oil policy can have an extraordinary effect on public opinion in our countries and we must be take care when talking about oil .
obviously , people are getting used to higher prices .
the price of oil has since risen to 30 dollars a barrel , yet there is no revolt - at one time , even that rise would have constituted a danger .
what I am trying to say here is that this is not an insignificant issue and we should make an effort to help stabilise prices - knowing full well that prices will , of course , tend to go up before they go down over the next few years , due to the shortage of oil and for ecological reasons , and that abrupt changes are dangerous .
the Commission published a communication back then , on which I should now like to congratulate it .
I think it is an exceptionally helpful and intelligent communication and I think the most important message - and it is this message which I also want to get across in my report - is that we need proper relations with OPEC .
we need dialogue with OPEC and , more importantly , we need the European Union to speak with one voice in this dialogue .
not with fifteen , with one .
I am pleased to pay you the compliment , Commissioner , but I would have said it anyway : it must be the Commissioner who speaks for the European Union .
I can imagine that the band which OPEC is aiming for will be pegged at between about 22 and 28 dollars a barrel .
even 30 dollars would not be a catastrophe , even if , because of inflation , we would , of course , be more comfortable with 25 rather than 30 dollars .
so where are the bones of contention , including here in Parliament ?
first , there is the question of tax harmonisation , of the harmonisation of duty on mineral oils .
I am an ardent advocate of this sort of harmonisation , although I know that many of my fellow members take a different tack , believing that tax policy should be subject to competition .
however , I think it is absolutely essential and fair , in the interests of truck drivers and haulage companies in competition with each other , that we harmonise competitive conditions .
the second divisive issue that is causing problems is the use of stocks .
now I too know that these stocks , which we have estimated at 90 days , are , of course , minute compared with the size of the oil fields underground and that releasing these stocks will have little impact on the cost of energy .
I am not so naive as to have overlooked this .
however , I believe that it makes sense , psychologically , to release them in a crisis , but I admit that we could argue the point .
the third point we need to discuss - and I am being very cautious here - is the use of fiscal instruments in the event of a crisis .
if you object that this is highly adventurous , then I would remind you that the French government granted tax relief back then , contrary to European directives , and has kept it in place to this day .
in other words , we have to deal with a real situation here , which we cannot allow to put us under pressure .
what gives me food for thought is that OPEC stands together with the USA on climate policy .
in other words , they are a partner in the US alliance , which could be dangerous when it comes to climate policy .
I really would like to be able to discuss climate policy with OPEC .
I think that we could well broker a compromise here .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should like to thank the Swedish Prime Minister , Mr Göran Persson , for once again joining us in Parliament and to say to him that in my Group &apos; s opinion , he has passed the test of his country &apos; s first presidency , with the seriousness and skill for which the Swedish government is well known .
I wish to point out that we greatly appreciate his government &apos; s desire to update our relations on issues as important as codecision and Council &apos; s presence in Parliament .
I think that we can consider the agreement on public access to documents - which could be improved , but which is an historical first - and the agreement on the information and consultation of workers , which had been on hold for many years , to be significant milestones .
I also hope , of course , that this experience will have helped imbue the Swedish people with a greater sense of affection for the European cause .
one special feature of this presidency has been its work on sustainable development , which it has not only established as a strategy for the future , but which it has also promoted through its clear and robust argument for ratifying the Kyoto Protocol .
this is not only an EU @-@ US issue , it is one that affects the whole world , as the Swedish Prime Minister and myself saw at the Council of the Socialist International last week in Lisbon .
another fundamental issue , that of enlargement , was also an area the Swedish presidency focussed on .
I should like to thank Mr Poettering , who expressed his support for a proposal that was originally put forward by my colleague , the vice @-@ chairman of our Group , Mr Hänsch .
the proposal was not the exclusive property of the PPE @-@ DE Group ; it could be said that it came from Parliament as a whole .
with regard to external policy , Sweden maintained its internationalist approach .
I feel that where the Middle East is concerned , not only was there a European majority behind the proposal in the Mitchell report , but also , for the first time , we are not only handing over money , we are also playing a leading role , as the Prime Minister pointed out .
his presence with Javier Solana in the Middle East was an important step forwards , which we must support , because it is crucial that we make progress with the Mitchell report and move beyond this point of departure .
in Macedonia too , we are sharing the burden with the Americans - which I think they are beginning to appreciate - and are playing a leading role .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council &apos; s visit to North Korea - which was initially something of a surprise - has also given us greater acknowledgement and greater influence with our American partners and the rest of the world .
I also wish to highlight the significant work Sweden has carried out in the United Nations with an old friend of ours , Pierre Schiori - whom we greatly miss - who has also done great work on behalf of Europe over the last six months .
I wish to pay particular tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs , Anna Lindh , who I would say has acted decisively , graciously and with her habitual charm in implementing all of the presidency &apos; s work .
one final point , to some extent , cast a shadow over the Göteborg Summit , namely the violent demonstrations that those of us who were there witnessed at first hand and also on television .
it must be said , first of all , that we fully respect people &apos; s right to demonstrate ; this is a citizen &apos; s fundamental right .
many people demonstrated peacefully in Nice and in Göteborg .
this is , of course , to be welcomed and appreciated , because it means that Europe &apos; s citizens are beginning to take an interest in what we do .
we continually complain that they do not take any notice of us but really , the fact that we are beginning to see active demonstrations about what we are doing is a positive development .
nevertheless , we must differentiate between the violent actions of small minorities who act like commandos and , with a nihilistic and violent attitude , seek to destroy the things for which we are working .
I wish to point out to Mr Poettering , that the problem is not whether these people are of the fascist or the antifascist persuasion .
the dividing line is between democrats and antidemocrats and we must remember that extremes clash , in politics too .
there is no need , then , to discuss whether the demonstrations are fascistic or not .
what is crystal clear is that these are people who are acting violently and with scorn for the institutions and for freedom .
I feel that given this scenario , we democrats must present a united front . it is not that some of us feel more affected than others about what has happened .
we have to adopt a very firm attitude on this .
my final observation , Madam President , concerns the debate on the future of Europe .
you have not managed to include the convention , but I hope that you will continue striving to ensure that we do so under the Belgian presidency .
I have noticed that recent events have borne out my predictions on 15 March and 3 May .
just read up on them in the Minutes , if you so wish .
I said then that pledging support to the Macedonian Government and condemning so @-@ called extremists would not lead to the search for solutions , peace and conciliation , but to the encouragement of violence .
a section of the Macedonian population and of the Macedonian Government believes that all the problems will be solved by ignoring or driving away the large Albanian minority .
that section is keen to buy weapons with EU subsidies .
they continue to reject an arrangement whereby Albanian becomes the language of administration and education for that part of the country where the Albanian @-@ speakers live .
I do not expect a sustainable solution without a state arrangement similar to that in Belgium .
I wish the Council and Commission much success in their attempts at long last to ensure that their interference does not lead to more violence and suppression , but to a peaceful solution which is sustained by all the parties
I , like many of my colleagues , have heard from blood donation organisations concerned by the possible modifications to existing legislation in this field .
everyone agrees in deploring , quite rightly , the shortage of blood and plasma within the European Union while stressing the fact that under no circumstances should we relax our vigilance regarding the quality of these products , so much so that the European Union &apos; s requirements are half covered by imports !
this directive , amended by Parliament , modifies , integrates and completes the legislation that currently governs quality and safety standards in Europe for the collection , testing , processing , storage and distribution of human blood and blood components .
it is about adopting stricter requirements regarding the admissibility of donors and practical screening of them , as well as putting in place a quality system at Community level in blood transfusion establishments .
this would all be completed by an equivalent testing and approval system in the Member States .
finally , common standards would be defined for staff training and for the traceability of blood from donor to patient .
of course , these measures will not prevent the Member States from maintaining or establishing stricter protection measures .
it is also desirable to reduce the European Union &apos; s dependence on imports of blood or blood components from third countries .
in order to do that , information campaigns need to be aimed at potential donors .
but under no circumstances should we envisage a system of payment for these products .
the European Parliament report rightly stresses the importance of the voluntary nature of blood donation while accepting that the social contribution made by donors and the commendable nature of the donations that they make should be highlighted .
as a blood donor myself and a supporter of the cause of blood donation , I therefore voted in favour of this report .
Mr President , immensely rich élites , members and accomplices of which have enjoyed university training , are attacking our financial , economic and security institutions .
this horrific tragedy requires a response .
the citizen asks the government to take action .
in terms of external policy , the European Union is able to do this because we increasingly speak with one voice .
the value of our input in the eradication of breeding grounds for terror has increased by leaps and bounds , as will be seen , I hope , in the near future .
as regards internal policy , we still cannot manage to speak with one voice .
basically , the &apos; every man for himself &apos; mentality still prevails .
fortunately , the Commission has realised that this is not acceptable .
Mr Vitorino , I would like to commend you on the fact that you , and the Commission , have realised that speaking with one voice on behalf of the European Union is absolutely necessary .
within the space of one week , you produced a detailed plan with proposals which are both practical and also truly necessary .
this will be rewarded in the form of the citizen &apos; s trust .
I hope that none of the Member States will dare to distance themselves from this critical plan , inviting the outrage of its own citizens in doing so .
needless to say , justice is important in this context , for we are dealing with a crime here , with whatever fine motives it is presented .
this is also evident in Northern Ireland where agreements contain terms which are used incorrectly and which are an insult to anyone who takes their religion seriously .
we have reason to be pleased with the Watson report which provides an initial impulse to the Parliament &apos; s endeavours and may be supplemented with propositions concerning the preparation of crimes which are committed elsewhere , that is , outside the European Union .
we trust that the Commissioner will not accept draft framework decisions which contain weak formulae such as we now see from time to time and which have absolutely no meaning whatsoever .
the real added value must lie in the fact that it becomes clear to the citizens that the European Union , as such , takes charge where guaranteeing internal security is concerned .
Madam President , it is a matter of regret and perhaps even of shame that it took the events of 11 September to push European governments into tackling effectively a problem which has plagued our continent for over a generation .
in 1997 in Amsterdam , and again in 1999 in Tampere in Finland , the Heads of State and Government committed themselves to tackling terrorism .
our review of progress early this year showed that they had done nothing about it , which was why we as a Parliament brought forward a report calling on them to take action .
the events of 11 September have fortunately brought such action and I look forward to travelling to Washington shortly to talk about common action between the European Union and the United States of America .
I would like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in drawing up this report , particularly the Members from Spain .
in my report , I broadly welcome the Commission proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and for a European arrest warrant .
the amendments which I put forward seek to restrict the list of crimes defined as terrorist crimes and covered by the European arrest warrant to the most serious cross @-@ border criminal offences , and if I may quote Amendment No 16 , it specifies those crimes &quot; which aim to destroy the fundamental freedoms , democracy , respect for human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law on which our societies are based . &quot;
we seek too to insert safeguards for civil liberties by basing action clearly on international human rights documents , by reinforcing the principle of ne bis in idem , by taking account of time spent in detention awaiting trial and by allowing Member States refusal to extradite when there are manifestly sound reasons for doing so , including in those cases where a person found guilty could face a penalty of death .
moreover , we seek to provide aids to victims of terrorism and their families .
I shall ask the House to accept one amendment , which was submitted after the deadline and which takes account of the most recent developments in Council .
one Member State is threatening to block progress towards a European arrest warrant .
there is a method - not one which I recommend - but one which may be needed in extremis , in order to press ahead , and that is to invoke Article 40 of the Treaty allowing reinforced cooperation between a certain number of Member States .
terrorism is a supranational challenge and calls for a supranational response .
we cannot allow the blockage of one Member State to prevent common action in fighting it .
when we met in this Chamber , on 12 September , we had a debate in which I remember Mr Poettering and many others said that we were all Americans .
since then , we have discovered that we must first be Europeans .
we acknowledge that recognition of judicial judgements and judicial standards requires trust in each other &apos;s systems , but not blind trust , and for that reason I have put forward an amendment calling for urgent measures to improve judicial systems in our Member States , to encourage benchmarking , to encourage exchange of best practice .
the process of creating an area of freedom , security and justice is similar to that of creating the single market , but it is more urgent and , moreover , we are dealing not with the freedom of movement of goods , services or capital , but with the freedom of people .
the Greens and other political groups are saying , don &apos;t go ahead until you are sure that everybody &apos;s judicial standards are perfect .
majority opinion , however , on the Committee recognises that the scope of the challenge we face and the historical imperative are such that we must press ahead with these measures with prudence , and with vigilance , but also with determination .
we must ensure effective action against terrorists and yet we must not deny legitimate political expression of grievances .
I was surprised to read in El País this morning an interpretation of one amendment , which I support , that it would outlaw Herri Batasuna .
I do not interpret the amendment in this way , nor would such an amendment be necessary to target those involved in supporting terrorist acts .
other provisions in what we are proposing do that .
I would say to colleagues , and particularly to our Spanish colleagues , that in our determination to tackle terrorism , we must acknowledge that terrorists sometimes express political grievances , and that these require a political response .
Council is discussing the proposals put forward by the Commission ; Parliament , which desperately needs powers of codecision , may be reconsulted on this matter .
we are determined to assist governments in their work and yet maintain the delicate balance between the security needs of our citizens and preservation of their democratic freedoms .
in this , cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs has received quite a boost .
whatever it was that we planned at Amsterdam , the paradox is that events are what drives Europe forward : just as Mr Haider &apos;s election led us to adopt effective legislation against racism and xenophobia , so it may be that Mr bin Laden has done much for European Union integration .
may I say , finally , what a pleasure it is to see you as a fellow Liberal Democrat in the Chair in this session .
I wish you a successful debate .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we live in the same world as the women of Afghanistan .
I should like to recall their Declaration of the Essential Rights of Afghan Women , which they adopted in Dushanbe on 28 June 2000 .
these were women issuing a call to action and not only victims .
I should also like to recall , as Mrs Gröner has just done , the Afghan Women &apos;s Summit , which concluded on 6 December 2001 , last week , and which issued a proclamation which it is important to be familiar with .
this proclamation says : Afghan women want their rights now , not tomorrow , not later on .
all these rights have been returned to them ; we therefore need to restore these rights now .
that is why I have tabled an amendment which I would ask you to support , calling for these rights to be re @-@ established as quickly as possible .
we need to give them the means to travel and to receive education and healthcare because ultimately we , the women of the same world as them , are a little anxious .
we are a little anxious and we call on the European institutions and the UN institutions to be vigilant .
paragraph 5 of the resolution calls for the UN to focus particularly on establishing equality between men and women in Afghanistan , because these women have really been the symbols of many things .
they have been the symbols of their own oppression , but they have also been the symbols of famine .
six months ago , when we were debating the situation in Afghanistan , they were the symbols of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues , and even of their own oppression .
it is not therefore a question of discarding the symbol once it has served its purpose .
it is a question of acting in such a way that the women are able to rediscover their rights and , for those who feel able to fight actively as representatives of all of the people , to participate in the government .
these women are active participants in this process and we live in the same world as they do .
they are demanding the freedom to travel and the recognition of habeas corpus ; I believe that these freedoms are the same as those enjoyed by Westerners and that we should not seek to draw a distinction between them .
that is why there is no secondary issue here , just one thing which I am asking you and that is , if possible , as an institution , to work to ensure that these freedoms are respected , because we are not sure that tomorrow will be any better than yesterday for these women .
. ( it ) Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this House and I wish you and the entire House a successful two and a half years .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the time has come to vote on the directive on public supply contracts , public service contracts and public works contracts and the directive on specific sectors - entities operating in the water , energy and transport sectors - in plenary . the Commission worked on them for four years , conducting a series of hearings , studies and assessments .
then Parliament worked on them for a further two years . a very well @-@ attended public hearing took place and the Committee of the Regions , trade associations and professionals from all over Europe were also consulted .
the fact that such a huge amount of work has been necessary should not surprise us , considering that public works contracts take up around 15 % of the Union &apos; s total GDP , that is over EUR 1 500 billion .
it is estimated that only 20 % of that sum is actually covered by the provisions of the current directives in that the threshold above which it is mandatory to apply them is relatively high and , in any case , more or less equal to that laid down in the agreements for the participation of third countries .
the current directives are now outdated and therefore need revising and bringing into line with new technologies and new market trends .
it was precisely the need to increasingly develop the internal market which prompted the Commission to research and propose the directives in question .
the subject is of considerable importance and could not and still must not be treated lightly .
in addition to individual Members , four Parliamentary committees delivering opinions and the committee responsible - the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - examined the texts and tabled amendments : almost more than half this House has been able to examine , debate and amend the texts .
it is a simple matter to summarise the contents : they revise and modernise the current directives , they introduce electronic auctions ; they clarify the standards on technical specifications , they define rules on award criteria , they simplify the thresholds and they introduce a Common Procurement Vocabulary .
overall , the proposals deserve our support and , indeed , have it : we are all aware of how important they are and we all want their path to be smooth .
however , the most significant past and present problems which have emerged and which are the subject of debate within the different political groupings , and between the groupings and between national representatives need to be highlighted .
the thresholds , or the value below which the directives are not binding .
this value , which - as I have said - is already relatively high , corresponds , however , to the value laid down in the agreements with third countries , in line with the Commission &apos; s proposal .
it has been proposed to increase this value .
that would raise two problems : it would reduce the number of work contracts required to comply with the directives , possibly to the advantage of third countries whose existing contracts cannot be reviewed .
it would also allow contracting authorities to operate outside the common rules , with the associated risks .
however , it has been maintained that , even if the thresholds are raised , the number of contracts awarded to European tenderers will not decrease because , below a certain value , it is not economically beneficial for businesses to operate away from their region , still less their country .
a further consideration is the possibility that each Member State and each regional government could apply local rules where the threshold is not reached .
that would mean that the higher the thresholds , the greater the disparities between legislation within the Union . thus , the rules within the Union would become even less uniform .
in my opinion , whatever the thresholds , we must not allow there to be differing legislation within the Union .
that would shrink , rather than expand the common market ; it would also make it possible for individual territorial legislative authorities to restrict access in their regional or national territory purely to local operators .
this should only happen where the matter is not regulated by the directives .
thus , the general contents of the directives must be included in national or regional legislation as well , and an amendment has been tabled proposing this .
another major issue is environmental and social concerns .
it has been proposed that the directive should incorporate specific rules governing these areas .
this suggestion has prompted broad , far @-@ reaching debate and could lead to the report being referred back to committee if a position supported by a sufficient majority is not achieved at the vote .
I feel that a law intended to further the internal market &apos; s development in an economic sector and increase competitiveness cannot introduce principles which are not already laid down by the sector &apos; s legislation .
the Commission &apos; s proposal contains sufficient provisions as it is to ensure that all the principles in force on the environment and workers &apos; rights are respected in the drawing up of calls for tender .
this legislation cannot be expanded or altered by means of directives whose scope should be limited to works , supply and service contracts .
the related amendments , adopted , moreover , at the vote by a number of committees delivering opinions and by the committee responsible , seek to introduce new rules .
were these amendments also to be adopted in plenary , I feel that it would be better to keep the current texts unaltered rather than to have texts which , although more up @-@ to @-@ date , could well mean a step backwards in basic areas .
there is a further issue which these texts cannot disregard but which the Commission has failed to deal with adequately : intellectual services .
the time has come to make a clear distinction between intellectual services and executive services , between design and execution .
this is a difficult concept for certain trade associations to take on board : as they see it , they are defending long @-@ established positions .
however , intellectual activity cannot be considered to be the same as manufacturing something and a company cannot do everything . it cannot carry out both design and execution , except in exceptional cases or where specific technologies are involved .
there are two of reasons for this : works of art are not quantifiable : no two ideas are alike .
the history of Europe as a whole , give or take a century , is full of different kinds of works which have survived the passage of time because of their artistic value .
not everything , not every service can be compared to a work of art , but the products of the mind cannot be confused with mere execution .
an executing company possesses skills and experience and executive technology and is therefore the most suitable company to design and implement others &apos; ideas on a technical level , but that is all , with a few rare exceptions .
by separating intellectual services from executive services we will be according the professions and the products of the mind their due value .
joint contract awards , where contracts for executive design alone and execution are awarded together , are appropriate if there are intellectual service providers qualified as such according to the prevailing legislation in the company or attached to it .
these considerations are the basis both for the amendment which makes it possible to award contracts for the design and execution of works either separately or together but requires justification to be produced where mixed contracts are awarded , and for the amendment which clearly defines what is meant by preliminary project paper , final project paper and executive project paper .
lastly , Mr President , two directives are before Parliament which are essentially similar in that certain specific sectors have been liberalised or will be in the not @-@ too @-@ distant future .
telecommunications are already considered to have been liberalised and are therefore not being taken into consideration .
the gradual liberalisation of the water , energy and transport sectors , monitored directly by the Commission or , upon request , by the individual States , will allow the second directive to expire without making it necessary to amend the first directive .
overall , I hope that objective considerations will prompt us to adopt provisions which are specific to the sectors without expanding on them dangerously , provisions which will increasingly further the development of the internal market , which take into account the forthcoming accession to the Union of other countries which have their own traditions and needs , and which will make our rules increasingly uniform rather than fragmented .
furthermore , I feel we ought to acknowledge that the work carried out by the Commission in its proposal deserves our greatest appreciation .
lastly , I have to say that I am proud to have helped to develop and , I hope , improve legislation which both contributes to the building of a more united , stronger Europe and also curbs the fraud and malpractice which very often prevail in economics .
precisely in order to prevent loopholes , it is better for the directives to suffer a setback , should this prove necessary , than to have rules which are too loose .
Mr President , Commissioner de Palacio , ladies and gentlemen , we have before us a directive on weights in international traffic , which is , of course , not only about weights , but also about dimensions .
this is a typical tactic , to have a heading announcing , actually very tersely , what is meant to be at issue , and then , in the directive in question , to proceed to expand on it as a matter of course .
I have already for some time now been following with a critical mind developments on European buses , because this wealth of detail was actually far from necessary at a European level .
we - and Parliament is at one on this point - are , at the end of the day , fighting for the principle of mutual recognition .
we should then , if at all possible , cause the principle of mutual recognition to prevail in fact .
let there be harmonisation only where it is really , absolutely necessary .
I wish at this point to commend the directive as an example of how short and precise an overall provision on European buses should be .
what I would really like is for this directive to abrogate all other directives on European buses , thus enabling countries and nations to have buses of a design appropriate to their needs , as , of course , a village bus in Sicily &apos;s hot climate has to look different from a bus in London &apos;s rush hour or a bus that has to cover great distances in northern Finland .
this is where harmonisation is false , costing a lot of money and calling for unnecessary effort .
this is where the Commission urgently needs to do some thinking about which areas require voluntary self @-@ regulation and which need standards to be laid down .
we have excellent standards committees , but only where they are absolutely necessary do we need framework directives .
Mr President , the British Labour Members did not support this report .
we do not support the extension of the marketing scheme for nuts . we recognise , however , that production is commonly found in less @-@ favoured areas , principally in Spain , and that much of the production is barely competitive and brings little economic return .
for these reasons it would make more economic sense to support the affected regions by a comprehensive programme for alternative crops or other activities that could be financed through the Rural Development Programme .
our vote accordingly urges the Commission to bring forward proposals to this effect .
we realise that these views are not universally popular but believe that they should ultimately result in a higher standard of living for the people affected .
this is preferable to continued subsistence living and uncertain financial provision from CAP funds .
we shall begin with the joint debate on the following motions for resolution :
( B5 @-@ 0146 / 2002 ) by Mrs Muscardini , on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , on Colombia ;
( B5 @-@ 0149 / 2002 ) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on Colombia ;

Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday we had a very solemn debate here in Parliament about the situation in the Middle East , and I think that the debate on Chechnya deserves the same degree of solemnity .
there is an open wound in Europe : in Chechnya , in the Russian Federation .
as members of the European People &apos;s Party , as European Democrats , we say that security in Europe , on our continent , in the twenty @-@ first century will depend on our having a democratic ...
... European Union , which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights , and on our having a democratic Russia , which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights , and on both - the European Union and Russia - working together as partners .
we want to have a strategic partnership of this kind because it is important for the future of our continent .
we must not remain silent , however , when human rights are violated , and of all people , we in the European Parliament must not remain silent .
some observers are saying that more people are dying in Chechnya than in the Middle East .
our group believes that a Chechen life is of equal value to the life of a citizen of the United States or a citizen of the European Union ...
? and that the life of a Muslim in Chechnya is of equal value to the life of a Christian , a Jew , a Palestinian , a Hindu , a Buddhist or a person of no belief .
human rights - and it is particularly because we are Europeans that this matters to us - are indivisible the world over .
the President of the Russian Federation is currently visiting a Member State of the European Union .
last night I heard his statement on Chechnya on German television .
the Russian Ambassador to the European Union , Mr Likhachev , and the President of the Committee for Foreign Affairs in the Duma , Dimitri Rogozin , called to see me last week in Brussels to inform me about the situation .
I am pleased that our debate on Chechnya has also provided an opportunity for them to contact our group .
clearly we have to fight terrorism , but we must not do so in such a way that this has a disproportionate impact on the human rights and lives of the people in Chechnya , of civilians who want to live in peace .
if a study from the US State Department dated 4 March , statements from Médecins Sans Frontières - an organisation which we esteem greatly because of its commitment - and the organisation Human Rights Watch , which is based in New York , all say that the Russian soldiers have hardly any respect for human life , then this has to set the alarm bells ringing .
if the Duma representative for Chechnya , Aslambek Aslakhanov , says - and this shows that Russia is also on the road to democracy , and we do of course recognise this - that 80 % of the aid which Russia provides for Chechnya is not even reaching the people , then this has to set the alarm bells ringing .
if Mary Robinson , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , says that the economic , social and cultural situation in Chechnya is very grave , despite some progress - which we have of course also noted - then this has to set the alarm bells ringing .
these are descriptions of the situation by organisations and high @-@ profile leaders who know more about what is happening than we do .
but it is our duty , as Members of the European Parliament , to debate these massive violations of human rights which are taking place in Russia and therefore in Europe , in Chechnya , for as long as they continue to be a reality .
we therefore call for a ceasefire and a political solution .
those Russian soldiers who have no respect for civilian lives , who have scant regard for human dignity and human life , should not only be criticised for their actions in political statements in Moscow ; we call for them also to be brought before the courts and for judgment to be passed on them , because if not the violations of human rights will just go on and on .
we also call on Russia to open up Chechnya to observers - to an even greater extent than it has done so far - and also to work with organisations in the European Union .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and also the Commissioner referred to this and generally speaking we are of the same mind .
in addition , we in the European Parliament should ask our delegation and the corresponding delegation in the Duma - and Parliament should as it were give the go @-@ ahead for this - to establish a well @-@ ordered procedure for attending to Chechnya properly on an ongoing basis .
soon - as we of course already decided on 16 March - we should send a European Parliament delegation to Chechnya and that region .
for my part I would very much welcome it if you , Commissioner , were personally to travel there to speak to those affected on the ground .
finally , we need to cooperate closely with Lord Judd of the Council of Europe , who is of course very involved in working on this problem , and overall we need a political solution .
allow me , in conclusion , to say the following : I have visited all of the republics of the former Soviet Union , including Tatarstan .
Tatarstan , the capital of which is Kazan , has a high degree of autonomy , indeed the greatest degree of autonomy in the Russian Federation .
why is it not possible for Chechnya to have something comparable ?
the representatives of Chechnya , who were here two months ago , appeared to have lost all hope ; they were depressed and their concern and despair were palpable .
it is our duty as the European Parliament to give hope to those who want to live in peace in Chechnya - within the Russian Federation , but with autonomous status of some kind - and to act as an advocate for human rights on this continent and throughout the world , including in Chechnya .
full understanding between our respective institutions and compliance with existing agreements between us are a prerequisite for Question Time to the Council to be properly conducted .
nonetheless , the time available to the Council , though it is the minimum required , is always very limited when it comes to drafting replies and having them approved by the Member States . I cannot provide any replies in Parliament unless they are approved by the Council in advance .
all the institutions shut down for several days . the Council would like to ensure that there is no repetition of situations such as the one we are confronted with today .
we would therefore appreciate it if both institutions could come to an agreement . it should then be able to avoid similar situations in the future , especially when holiday periods intervene .
at a stage when our Presidency is making an unprecedented effort to achieve interinstitutional understanding - I must stress that there has been nothing like this in the past - I really do not want this matter to be blown up out of all proportion . there is no need to make a mountain out of a molehill .
there simply has not been enough time . there have not been enough hours in the day to produce replies , and there has not been time either to have the replies approved by the Council and by Council delegations .
I suggest we provide written replies . these questions would anyway have been replied to in writing .
let me remind you that it is almost 6 p.m. We were already half an hour late starting , so we will not even be able to reply to all the questions agreed to , let alone the additional ones .
I should also like to point out , because I feel it is relevant , that the question Mr De Rossa has particularly in mind relates to Palestine . you will recall that an important debate on the situation in the Middle East took place in the House yesterday afternoon .
there was no reason why Mr De Rossa could not have put his name forward and asked his question yesterday . both the High Representative and I were present on behalf of the Council , and we would have been delighted to answer it .
Mr President , despite the tragic events of 11 September , the tourism industry is alive and well .
in fact , it is even enjoying a phase of permanent expansion at European and global level .
as an economic sector , the tourism industry accounts for 5 % of jobs in the European Union .
the lion &apos;s share of the activities and of employment is generated by some 2 million small and medium @-@ sized businesses , together making up some 8 million people .
furthermore , this employment is spread across different service sectors , such as transport and the hotel trade .
small and medium @-@ sized businesses are therefore clearly the driving force behind , and platform for , European tourism .
this is why the proposed actions must be coupled with actions in the framework of the multi @-@ annual programme for small and medium @-@ sized businesses .
to the question whether Community tourism policy should be developed for the tourism industry , the answer remains negative , at least for the time being .
this does not detract from the fact that tourism policy must be coordinated more effectively and better managed .
tourism policy often gives a fragmented and chaotic impression .
this is why actions in the field of harmonisation of information , the establishment of harmonised labels and networking must be strongly encouraged .
in addition , the Commission &apos;s initiative to establish an annual , European tourism forum at which the sector itself can set its priorities , receives our full support .
in short , closer cooperation between all parties involved in order to make tourism more competitive and sustainable , appears to be a priority .
Mr President , I fully support the Commission &apos;s endeavours to simplify the legislative framework from 17 directives to a single regulation .
however , Commissioner , precisely because this is a regulation , you know better than I do that prudence must be exercised , for the regulation will be implemented immediately and , by its nature , harmonises , or rather , I would say , as good as standardises all the procedures throughout the vast area of the Union in the food and gastronomy sector , which , we must never forget , is a major part of the culture and civilisation of our continent .
I therefore agree that there is a need for harmonisation , but we must remember to exercise caution .
I would like to focus on three points , in particular . the first , which has been fully addressed in the report and by the rapporteur , is the question of traditional products , products which have a history not just as products but in terms of their production processes too .
restricting these products to geographical areas or local markets is not enough : they are genuine products which need to be dealt with separately .
secondly , the question of the primary sector , which is certainly not fully covered by the regulation but which is regulated to some extent .
the situation is different for the primary sector , particularly where small and medium @-@ sized businesses are concerned .
I have tabled an amendment which I urge you to support , which seeks , at least , to reduce the bureaucratic , administrative impact as regards keeping documents - it makes no sense for records relating to vegetables to have to be kept for five years .
thirdly - apart from the question of game , which I will mention briefly in passing , with regard to which a balanced solution appears to have been found - there is training .
it is right to ensure that our food chain operators are always trained .
with regard to this aspect too , we must avoid enlarging the scope of the debate to include quality , which is a separate issue : there must be training on hygiene and hygiene alone .
Mr President , first of all , I do not think this emergency resolution is the best way to help solve the still worrying situation in Gujarat , mainly because the violence seen in this state during recent months is a manifestation of an extremely complex phenomenon affecting the whole region and not just India .
it involves social factors such as poverty , urban &apos; ghettoisation &apos; , some interference by organised crime with unknown links abroad , a certain inability of the political elite to mobilise people &apos;s energies around political ideals and the drift towards the religious sphere , especially through fundamentalist extremism .
it is , however , quite right that the European Parliament should feel concern for a case that has already cost the lives of a about thousand people - or even more , as estimates vary according to the source .
this is not the time to analyse the episodes that gave rise to this violence , but it is worth pointing out that everything began with the fire in two train carriages on 27 February last , in which 58 people died , half of them women and children .
nothing can justify this kind of action , and the retaliations and revenge that followed cannot be justified at all , either .
Godhra , it should be remembered , is a peripheral urban area with a high population density and a level of latent social conflict , where the forces of law and order generally find it difficult to act , apart from the possible involvement of members of the local police in one or other religious faction , according to the results of inquiries so far .
what is certain is that at first the forces of law and order did not succeed in putting an end to the violence .
the matter was , however , taken up immediately by the democratic institutions of the Indian Union , namely the government , the opposition parties and parliament .
I did in fact visit the Indian Parliament on the very days when this subject was discussed .
urgent measures were adopted not only on the government &apos;s own initiative but also because of strong pressure from the opposition and the Indian media .
I must point out that stands adopted outside the Indian democratic system itself , however well intentioned they may be , sometimes end up being counterproductive in that they bolster nationalist and fundamentalist positions of various origins , Islamic or Hindu .
in any case , on behalf of my group , I recommend adoption of this resolution without any changes , as we consider it well balanced .
Madam President , my opinion dealt largely with the technical progress of the Commission &apos;s negotiations with the candidate countries on the relevant chapters , but it also called on both the Council and the Commission to redouble their efforts to raise awareness of public opinion .
I wonder whether in their summing @-@ up replies both Minister de Miguel and Commissioner Verheugen might refer to progress , as far as public opinion is concerned , and any further initiatives they have in mind .
we all pay lip service to this - bearing in mind the referenda - but much greater practical application is required , in particular from the Member States , not simply from the institutions of the European Union itself .
I have three thoughts concerning action in the Member States .
firstly , further public platforms should be given to leaders from the candidate countries , not only political but also cultural leaders - writers , film @-@ makers , and musicians .
secondly , the links between the institutions of civil society should be publicised .
thirdly , something should be done to overcome the collective amnesia which was imposed by the Soviet tyranny on western Europe , allowing us to forget the thousand years of cultural , political and commercial links which we are now in the process of restoring .
we have voted against the Brok report on enlargement .
quite obviously , we are not opposed to integrating new countries into the EU . nonetheless , we have reservations about the way in which the negotiations are currently proceeding .
we are also concerned about the burden faced by the candidate countries in transposing the &apos; acquis communautaire &apos; , which varies between 70 000 and 90 000 pages of text , depending upon the translation .
where agricultural , health and environmental matters are concerned , the challenges are enormous .
moreover , making the entry of these countries conditional upon their strict observance of the legislation on the protection of biodiversity is unfair . let us not forget that these countries are coming to us to consolidate peace on the continent of Europe , develop their infrastructures and make up for having been behind economically because of their insufficiently developed infrastructures .
let us not forget this .
. ( NL ) Large @-@ scale fishing at sea is organised in very different ways in different Member States .
in one country , small , traditional ships may be used , while other countries may use large , modern ships which , by way of compensation , have to remain idle for part of the time .
fishermen from one country may catch fish for human consumption , while those from other countries may fish for the production of fishmeal .
everywhere , fishermen from one country blame fishermen from other countries for exceeding their catch quotas , so that fish is in danger of extinction in an increasingly large maritime area .
it now also transpires that the Netherlands produces illegible annual reports , Belgium uses unintelligible codes , Spain &apos;s submission is incomplete and France does not submit any reports at all .
since the control mechanism is applied differently in different Member States , fishermen are not treated in the same way .
it is starting to appear more and more as if we are deluding ourselves into thinking that we are drastically reducing fish catches , without this actually happening to an adequate degree .
and meanwhile , a full @-@ scale rebellion is being mounted against the European Commission proposals to make effective and tighten up the policy to protect fish levels at sea .
no doubt , this will not come to anything either .
a policy is therefore being adopted in the spirit of &apos; après nous le déluge &apos; .
do the advocates of a weak policy believe that such a flood will yield more fish ?
Mr President , noise pollution has a significant effect on the well being of very many European citizens .
noise in the areas close to airports often reaches a level that is unbearable for millions of our fellow citizens .
that is why it is absolutely essential to combine regulatory methods with economic instruments in order to minimise noise pollution .
the first measure that should be taken is to withdraw the noisiest aircraft .
this measure has only been partially implemented so far .
we are aware that many aircraft , which only just meet the standards described in Chapter 3 , continue to use airports in Europe .
it is now imperative that we supplement the regulatory measures with economic instruments .
therefore , using charges and applying the polluter pays principle is certainly a good initiative .
we therefore welcome the Commission &apos;s proposal , which seeks to introduce a system of charges in a harmonised Community framework .
the aim is to encourage airlines to use the quietest aircraft and , in addition , to avoid dumping between airports . noise dumping of this kind is obviously very harmful to citizens living close to these airports .
that said , although the Commission &apos;s proposal is sound in principle , when it is examined in more detail , it can be seen that it is not sufficiently rigorous or effective , as the rapporteur has already pointed out .
according to this proposal , then , the introduction of charges is optional , which will inevitably bring about a dumping policy .
moreover , the differentiation between types of noise pollution is insufficient .
since the proposed ratio of 1 : 20 between the highest and lowest noise charge was insufficient , the rapporteur suggested increasing this ratio from 20 to 40 , which is wholly acceptable .
by and large , we agree with the proposals made by the rapporteur , but we added one element to these proposals that the rapporteur unfortunately rejects , namely to take into account the level of noise at night and the level of noise during the day / night / evening , which are two extremely important indicators of noise pollution which allow us to differentiate between charges .
we hope that the rapporteur reviews his position and takes into account the problem of noise at night because it is obvious that this problem is certainly the most harmful nuisance that one can encounter .
we are not going to solve the problem with charges alone , but in any case , this measure will help to improve the situation .
Mr President , I am going to speak about the Johannesburg Summit .
with regard to the Hulthén report , my colleague , Peter Liese , will address this issue .
unlike what many tried to do , and which amounted to condemning the summit to failure even before it began , Parliament set out for Johannesburg with considerable ambition : in other words , we did not join in with the cynical approach of those who sought to lower expectations before setting off in order to be able then to make small victories appear to be major ones .
we adopted this approach for two reasons : first , because this is what the world required .
the world is in a state of emergency , in both the environmental and the social fields , and so achieving a merely reasonable result at the summit was not acceptable to this Parliament .
second , because this was an opportunity that did not arise ten years ago and which will not arise in the next few years .
it would , therefore , have been a tragic mistake not to take advantage of this opportunity .
we set out , then , with considerable ambition and with a great spirit of unity and of solidarity between all the political groups .
and at the end of the summit , I must say that although we moved in the right direction and we went further than Rio , we achieved less than what was needed .
admittedly , some results were achieved , but these are by no means sufficient to reverse the signs of unsustainability afflicting the planet .
on the positive side , in addition to what the Danish Presidency and the Commission have highlighted in terms of timetables and targets , specifically for poverty , water and health , I would highlight as equally positive the change in the character of the summit .
whereas in Rio we did not get beyond the concept of sustainable development , Johannesburg was associated with action .
the nature of the summit took a qualitative leap forwards .
secondly , a qualitative leap was also taken in terms of concepts : sustainable development made a very close link between the environment and poverty .
and I think that another qualitative leap was the desire to eradicate poverty and , at the same time , to put a brake on environmental degradation .
thirdly , in terms of the actors : reversing unsustainability stopped being an obligation of nations , of states alone .
with the huge number of partnerships approved , the participation of civil society has been guaranteed .
both the public and private sectors are committed to this objective of sustainable development .
on the negative side , it was obviously a disappointment that no quantified targets were set for renewable energies or for reversing lost biodiversity .
I would , however , add a point not mentioned either by the Danish Presidency , or by the Commission , and which I believe is negative : it is the fact that no boost was given to institutional reform in the field of the environment .
this summit could have been used to ensure the &apos; greening &apos; of the existing institutions , such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation , but also to launch new institutions that place globalisation at the service of sustainable development .
I am thinking , for example , of a World Environment Organisation .
this issue was not mentioned or discussed , and played no part in the summit , and this was deplorable .
I have one last thing to say , also on the negative side , with regard to Kyoto .
many people have placed Kyoto on the positive side of the balance @-@ sheet of this summit .
I would put it on the negative side .
it is true that Russia , Canada , India and China made very fine declarations with regard to the future . what was expected of this summit , however , was not declarations or intentions about Kyoto : what was hoped for was for the summit to lead to the practical implementation of the Kyoto Protocol .
and ten years after the Rio Summit , Kyoto has still not begun to exist in practice .
I wish to say one last thing about the role of Parliament and our relationship with the Commission and with the Council .
we tend , at these summits , to praise the Commission and to criticise the Council .
this time , things were reversed : our relationship with the Danish Presidency was excellent , transparent , highly cooperative and , unfortunately , this time , with the Commission , we did not see the same level of cooperation that we have grown accustomed to at the conferences on climate change with Commissioner Wallström .
we have always enjoyed excellent cooperation at the summits on climate change . unfortunately , this time there was neither transparency , nor cooperation , nor sufficient collaboration .
Mr President , the honourable Member &apos;s question relates to the interoperability of interactive television services and the role of the MHP standard .
the question contained five points , which I will respond to individually .
firstly , on the first point , I can acknowledge that the adoption of the framework directive in the field of communications represents a powerful signal both for operators in the digital television market and for consumers .
the directives which will come within this framework will allow us to achieve three important objectives .
firstly , to give broadcasters access to the networks and to connected equipment such as electronic guides and programmes .
next , to prevent excessive regulation through the application of proportional access solutions and finally to benefit the consumer by contributing to the provision of a wide range of services .
if we consider the legal position established in Article 18 of the framework directive for electronic communication services and networks , the Member States must encourage openness in relation to the provision of an application programming interface ( API ) .
no particular API technology or single API will be laid down .
the MHP standard satisfies the needs of interoperability and openness in this field .
this is why we are encouraging the voluntary application of this standard by the sector .
the second point relates the date of publication of the standards applicable in the field of MHP .
my reply is that the list of standards will be published after the meeting of the committee responsible for communications on 2 October .
third point ; the use of a non @-@ standardised API technology may give a company power on the market .
the directive in question lays down specific solutions which may be used by national regulation bodies to control the power of certain companies on the market .
since it guarantees interoperability and offers users greater freedom of choice , standardisation will certainly contribute to preventing the appearance of monopolies .
however , in itself competition is not a measure of fair competition .
dominant players may appear , even when there are open standards .
on the fourth , as I said in the reply to the first point of the question , the objectives of the regulation are openness and interoperability .
the MHP standard meets the needs of interoperability and openness in this field .
this is why we are providing political support for the voluntary application of this standard by the sector .
however , the sector also wishes to hold a dialogue on interoperability , particularly on migration .
we have therefore launched a debate and sectoral investigation into interoperability .
with regard to the fifth point , in its declaration to the plenum on 12 December 2001 , the Commission committed itself to publishing the relevant MHP standards in a list of standards to be published in the Official Journal , in accordance with Article 17 of the framework directive .
pursuant to this directive , the Member States must encourage the application of the standards contained on the list .
secondly , the Commission is committed to examining , a year after the entry into force of the directive , whether interoperability and freedom of choice for users have reached a satisfactory level in the Member States .
if that is not the case , the Commission will be able to propose making the use of these standards obligatory .
in accordance with our commitments , we will provide a list of standards after the meeting of the competent committee on 2 October , as I have just said .
they are scheduled to be examined between now and July 2004 .
Article 18 of the framework directive demands that Member States encourage the use of an open API .
the Commission will therefore hold a dialogue with the Member States and national regulation bodies , by means of the committee .
the MHP will certainly be amongst the subjects discussed within the framework of this dialogue .
the widespread adoption of the MHP seems to be the most obvious means of achieving interoperability .
businesses must take the initiative in terms of creating migration strategies since migration itself raises many technical and commercial problems .
we are pleased with the sustained efforts of the sector to resolve these problems and reach agreements , at national or European level , in view of the transfer to MHP .
Mr President , in its communication on the progress made in accession negotiations , the Commission confirms that Cyprus will be part of the first wave of accession , as decided at the Copenhagen Summit .
I would like to thank the Commission , and in particular Commissioner Verheugen , for this proposal which responds fully to the expectations of the European Parliament and which should surprise nobody .
throughout the negotiation process , we have seen complete agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament over the fundamental elements of the Cypriot dossier .
it also appears now that accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus have been a powerful catalyst in the United Nations &apos; efforts to solve the political problem of the island in accordance with the rules of international law .
although nothing has been achieved as yet , and despite the threats of annexing and crisis from Ankara , the recent communication from the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations is still based on the idea that a political framework solution can be found by the end of the year .
Parliament , in its latest resolutions , clearly listed the conditions with which such an arrangement would have to comply for Cyprus to be able to fully meet its obligations as a Member of the EU .
the Cypriot federal state must possess a central government as well as a parliament to control it , which is able to take all decisions within the framework of the Treaty , as well as participating in these policies .
it would also have to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the island &apos;s territory .
the awakening of civil society and the surveys carried out in northern Cyprus confirm that the majority of the Turkish Cypriot population is also in favour of a pro @-@ European policy .
I therefore hope that vigorous political will will make it possible to overcome the remaining obstacles and that the forces of the Union will triumph over the forces of division .
in the absence of this policy , or if it were hindered by external interference , the Copenhagen European Council would have to take its decisions in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions .
Mr President , after September 11 , a broad international coalition was formed to combat terrorism .
this battle is still taking place here in Europe .
al Qaida sleeper networks still remain in 52 countries .
after 30 January this year , President Bush &apos;s speech on the state of the Union disconcerted many Europeans .
the countries described as &apos; the axis of evil &apos; no longer had anything to do with international terrorism .
fortunately , at the time , Commissioner Patten spoke out , clearly distancing himself from the unilateral , over @-@ simplistic American policy .
the US is now trying to impose a concept of pre @-@ emptive war against Iraq which falls outside the scope of international law .
in today &apos;s speech by the American Government , it was no longer possible to dissociate concerns about oil from legitimate concern over weapons of mass destruction , equally legitimate concerns over human rights and Saddam Hussein himself as a person , whom Mr Bush professes to hate .
we should not adopt this mixed bag as our own approach , since the various factors need to be addressed separately .
Europe has always backed the United Nations Security Council .
for the past few months , however , we have witnessed a veritable bid , instigated by the United States , to take control of international law - a policy of double standards . in some cases violations of human rights and United Nations Security Council resolutions are flouted and go unpunished , while in others they are not .
we are also witnessing major internal division within the European Union and preparation for a war that would constitute a real confrontation between civilisations and would undoubtedly strengthen the terrorism we are trying to fight .
in this strong @-@ arm contest , this race against time , it is the credibility of the UN and Europe that is at stake .
one thing is certain , if there is military intervention in Iraq , the Iraqi people , who have already suffered so much , will defend themselves to the last and we will not enter Baghdad as liberators .
I was pleased with Mr Prodi &apos;s call for more political enthusiasm with regard to enlargement .
I can inform my fellow MEPs that as a member of the Convention on the future of Europe , I have the privilege of already working very closely with our colleagues from the candidate countries and that their commitment and enthusiasm for the European project are a pleasure to behold .
what Mr Gollnisch said , namely that nobody in this Convention has given any thought to what a Union with 25 Member States would need to do , and whether this would be different from 6 or 15 Member States , is incorrect .
I am , however , concerned about another matter .
if we want to make a success of this Union of 25 , I do believe that the Convention members should aim a little higher in terms of a strong and democratic Europe with proactive institutions .
it is also very important , in my view - and I am addressing a point made by Mrs Thyssen here - that our enthusiasm for this enlargement and this political European project does not remain confined to European political élites . the people must also be involved .
I was therefore particularly pleased with Mr Prodi &apos;s call for information campaigns intended for the public at large .
we at our end all do our utmost to explain to the citizens what enlargement is about , but we cannot do this alone .
there are , however , sufficient arguments to suggest that enlargement will offer answers to people &apos;s questions rather than raise new problems .
I would therefore like to join those fellow MEPs who ask how the Commission , the Member States and the Heads of Government can help us in our duty to inform .
the issue of monitoring and safeguard clauses are of particular importance as a way of reassuring the public because it demonstrates , Commissioner Verheugen , that we take enlargement seriously .
you spoke about monitoring in the context of police , justice and the internal market .
I would like a guarantee from you that this monitoring procedure and the safeguard clauses also apply to social policy and environmental policy , as these are , after all , very closely connected to the internal market .
it is particularly in these areas that you could offer reassurance to the public , in my view .
Mr President , I also welcome the progress made in this report on the Fiscalis programme for the next five years .
I would particularly like to welcome and draw attention to the statement in the common position .
as the rapporteur has already mentioned , it points out that this is not a political programme , but one designed to enhance administrative cooperation between Member States &apos; tax officials .
it is important that we are clear about this objective .
we are talking here about improving administration , and not in any way about tax harmonisation .
when it was first proposed that the extension of the programme was going to be aimed at direct taxation , there was a lot of concern , particularly in the UK , that this might lead to measures to introduce harmonisation of direct taxes .
we therefore welcome the fact that the common position clearly states this will not happen .
if I may speak on behalf of the UK once again , we particularly welcome this because we have been among the most active users of the Fiscalis programme over the last few years .
we think it is very valuable , so I would certainly be concerned if anything happened to detract from the programme and make it more difficult for certain Member States to take part in it .
the programme has much to offer .
it has introduced exchanges of officials ; it has introduced seminars on tax issues of common interest ; it has provided multilateral control exercises , it has developed professional training , such as audit skills ; it has improved language training and it has maintained and developed communication and information exchange systems .
that is all very good stuff and to be welcomed , continued and improved upon .
what we are always trying to do in these sort of situations is improve the way that the systems work and get things to work better .
certainly , that has been one of the achievements of the Fiscalis programme .
therefore , it is to be regretted , as the Commissioner said , that we are seeing a cut in the budget .
all we can hope is that the budget , as it now stands , will be adequate to take the programme forward .
so , on the whole , I welcome the common position and the fact that it looks as if we are going to be able to achieve an agreement and get the programme extended .
I also welcome the fact that we are very clear now that this is not about tax harmonisation in any way , but about administrative systems .
Mr President , temporary work agencies are a necessary part of the flexible labour market of the future .
the recruitment difficulties of companies are solved to an increasing extent by taking on staff from temporary work agencies .
immigrants often gain excellent opportunities to get a foothold in the labour market through these companies .
it is therefore important to encourage and facilitate the activities of temporary work agencies .
we have heard here that legislation regulating temporary work agencies varies greatly from Member State to Member State . it is therefore difficult to create even framework legislation which takes into account all the differences .
the political starting points for the proposal for a directive are to view work done for temporary work agencies as a variation on temporary employment , and to prevent what has come to be known as social dumping .
the problems with framework legislation at European level are clear when one looks at Sweden .
here , the political starting points are not reflected in the actual conditions .
in Sweden , permanent employment is the rule . around 70 % of those employed through temporary work agencies are on permanent contracts .
terms and conditions of employment are regulated by collective agreements for both permanent and temporary employees .
the salary of white @-@ collar workers is set individually and separately , which means that no pay comparisons can be made .
blue @-@ collar workers have collective agreements guaranteeing that pay will not fall below the pay in the user undertaking and that the working hours of the user undertaking will apply .
this is not regulated in law , however , but through negotiations between the social partners , as should continue to happen in the future .
this is why we do not believe that pay should be included in the directive &apos;s definition of terms and conditions of employment .
nor should comparisons of pay and terms and conditions of employment be regulated in the directive .
the temporary work agency sector functions well in Sweden and could be a model for Europe .
there you are , Mr Andersson .
however , the proposal before us does not facilitate development of this sector in Europe .
Europe needs more forms of employment , not fewer .
Madam President , a great deal has been said this evening on this subject .
each speaker has explained his position calmly and resolutely , and , indeed , I do not even want to use all the time available to me for fear of repeating what has already been said .
directive 86 / 609 laid down provisions which reflected the - as yet quite limited - understanding of that time . over 15 years have passed since that directive , during which time I would say it has had hardly any effect at all , for every day we receive news not of progressive alignment with the directive but of ill @-@ treatment of animals and unlawful behaviour .
the States have to a large degree failed to comply with the directive ; the whole of society - human society as well as , of course , the animal kingdom - has not felt protected .
the report contains a number of very specific provisions on the behaviour of what are , indeed , major countries - Austria , Belgium , France , Ireland , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain and the United Kingdom - which have behaved in different ways but , in any case , in such a manner as to justify the assertion that almost all the States have failed to comply with the directive for a long time .
this failure to comply has taken different forms but it is still failure to comply .
few countries in the European Union have escaped criticism , and that may well be because they were not yet part of the European Union at the time in question and have therefore not been assessed .
I believe that there must be an undertaking in this regard .
the report &apos;s proposals are certainly sound , the recommendations made by the Commissioner - although I feel she is a little overoptimistic - are certainly sound , but the important thing is for the legislation to be implemented , and so we need inspectors , we need monitoring , we need all possible endeavours to ensure that the directive is respected , even before we start to revise it .
let me read out what the President ruled .
he deemed Amendment No 4 inadmissible in its present form .
if the rapporteur agrees to modify it by deleting the reference to the current Commission proposal - a reference which would not be relevant once the legal instrument is adopted - then Amendment No 4 would be acceptable .
this is what we did .
the only thing the President says in his letter about Amendment No 17 is &apos; I declare this amendment inadmissible &apos; .
he is not saying that in any modified form it could be accepted ...
rapporteur , I owe you an apology .
I have just been told there is a typographical error .
the President meant to say that he now declares this amendment admissible .
I apologise .
okay , I resign !
one of the most important activities and one activity that we are very pleased to continue funding is the logistical work provided by the Danish Refugee Council - the only non @-@ Russian operation that delivers food and all other items inside Chechnya .
they use local drivers , but the whole organisation is provided by that NGO .
this is also recognised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and by the UN system in general .
it is a very important achievement because it provides access for the humanitarian community .
so the answer to the question of whether we are able to monitor the whole flow is that we are doing it as well as possible .
on a number of occasions over the years I have informed Parliament that we are working on the basis of a so @-@ called &apos; remote @-@ control &apos; concept , which means that we have to use local implementing partners .
however , so far we have not run into problems relating to accountability .
we are trying to track every activity as carefully as possible .
I would say that , as long as we are able to keep the operation carried out by the Danish Refugee Council up and running , we have some security in terms of knowing what is going on .
the input from the UN organisations is also crucial in this respect and our cooperation with them is quite well developed .
the problem of the people who are more or less willing to go back - and we fear they are fewer in number - is that they go back into all kinds of different situations .
this is why we are criticising the pressure that they are under .
we are clearly worried .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to put four questions to this Chamber .
let me start with a photograph that I have seen in the German press , and in the French press as well ; it shows the American defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld in Baghdad , shaking hands with Saddam Hussein in a friendly way .
the photograph was taken at a time when Mr Rumsfeld was President Reagan &apos;s special envoy for relations with the Middle East .
might it be the case that , at that time , Mr Rumsfeld discussed the supply of armaments ?
let me put another question . why will the American administration provide evidence only after 5 February ?
if there were evidence that Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction , the United States of America would be under an obligation to produce such evidence at once and supply it to the weapons inspectors .
why only from 5 February onwards ?
my third question is this . Mrs Stenzel said that the measures needed to deal with North Korea were different from those that are appropriate to Iraq .
so let her tell us what they are !
here is one state , North Korea , which announces that it is building atomic weapons .
so the United States of America says , &apos; We shall negotiate with you . &apos;
another state apparently possesses weapons of mass destruction , and the response of the United States is to say , &apos; We are not negotiating with them ; we shall declare war . &apos;
where is the logic in that , if that is not purely arbitrary ?
let me put my last question . might it not be that the coalition against terrorism , so laboriously forged in the aftermath of 11 September , might be destroyed by a warlike act that had not been thought through beforehand ?
might there not be heads of Muslim states , prepared to work together with the Western community of states , but who would not be able to remain in the anti @-@ terror coalition if there were hostilities in Iraq ?
and might it not be the case that what is advocated by Mrs Stenzel and others - and obviously you , Mr Morillon , as well - might become the greatest campaign for recruiting terrorists that we have seen in recent years ?
if you can answer all these questions in the negative , then you can count yourselves lucky .
I fear that you will have to answer them with &apos; yes &apos; , and that is why my government is right to say that what this region needs is more peace , rather than war , of which it has already had enough .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for that very insightful analysis of what has been going on .
this resolution is an important step forward in favour of international law and the rule of law .
as we speak , there are some 48 civil conflicts around the world - the majority of them in Africa - being conducted largely in the promotion of one or more supposed sectional or tribal interests .
sub @-@ Saharan Africa has seen millions of people massacred , genocide committed , whole tribes ethnically cleansed in the last 20 years .
ostensibly , these conflicts have been based , as in Angola or Rwanda , on so @-@ called historic divisions .
but the reality is that an underlying factor in most of these cases has been commercial gain , based on supposed tribal protection .
various sectional and commercial interests , some of them based in Europe , have tried to exploit these differences for commercial gain to procure the supply of diamonds , timber , oil , gold , cobalt , titanium and vanadium .
Africa is supposed to be one of the richest continents in the world , inhabited by the poorest people in the world .
how can this be so ?
this is so because the rule of law and international law has not operated in Africa for a long time .
the Democratic Republic of Congo has been exploited , looted and robbed .
its people have been set against one another , encouraged to massacre each other and sometimes to commit genocide , so that powerful vested interests outside Africa can collude and gain advantage .
this report by the United Nations Security Council is a seminal report in that it sets out for the first time to establish that international law incorporates a moral right to a concept of shared sovereignty , that sovereignty is not merely what is defined in the Montevideo Convention or President Wilson &apos;s 14 @-@ point rule , and that in a global trading environment as we see now with the WTO and global rules on trade , we have to share our sovereignty when the rule of law becomes paramount .
if we can penalise the United States for doing something wrong with its steel , why is it that we are not able to do something in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , where millions of people have been exploited and killed for commercial gain ?
so I welcome this resolution and I commend it .
Mr President , it is with great regret , not to say anguish , that I see the outcome of the vote on the motion today in this House .
it is tragic to see that , like the Council , Parliament too has decided not to speak out .
the deserted Chamber is , at this moment , the tragic symbol of our behaviour in this international crisis which is proving so terrible .
this sign of impotence can only be a cause of pain to all those who have always hoped and continue to hope that Europe will be to the world a shining example of balance , progress , peace and guaranteeing respect for the rights of peoples and international law .
despite the fact that no resolution has been adopted , there were significant votes , the most important of which would appear to be that in which Parliament opted by a large majority for a common foreign and security policy with areas of enhanced cooperation .
this is the only glimmer of hope in the despair which follows a vote which does us no credit .
we wholeheartedly support items 46 @-@ 53 of the report , which are all designed to underline the high costs of the European Parliament &apos;s travelling circus as it moves between Brussels , Luxembourg and Strasbourg .
as the rapporteur points out , Parliament &apos;s moving between Brussels and Strasbourg entails additional costs for taxpayers amounting to approximately EUR 169 million per year .
what is more , moving makes Parliament &apos;s work considerably less efficient .
the solution is for Parliament &apos;s activities to be concentrated in one place of work .
if this is to be possible , the Member States need to listen to reason and amend the Treaty so that Parliament itself is able to determine where it sits .
the European Convention can make an important contribution by giving impetus to the debate on Parliament &apos;s seat so that change really can come about .
Green light - On behalf of my group I would like to express my total support for an early enlargement , stressing the principle of equal treatment with regard to the Copenhagen criteria .
I hope that the signature of the Accession Treaty will represent the final unification of our continent , leaving behind the wars which desolated our peoples and drew up borders by force .
the new and strengthened Union will be a continent with a shared destiny of peace , democracy and freedom .
solidarity - This unprecedented enlargement brings new challenges for the Union .
we will need an even greater spirit of solidarity in all our common policies , and we will have to strengthen the institutional capacities of the Union .
the current and future Members will have to make the greatest possible effort , replacing national egotism with Community solidarity in order to find , as the Treaties demand , a united European voice in world political fora .
budgetary conflict - Although an agreement was reached at the last moment , I must strongly criticise the Council &apos;s unilateral action of including budgetary figures in the Accession Treaty .
this is an unprecedented action which constitutes a serious attack on the budgetary competences of our House and the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you may be aware , I am the Chairman of the Delegation to the EU @-@ Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee .
over the last year , we have spoken about the situation in Russia on a number of occasions .
in doing so , we have also very specifically spoken about the situation in Chechnya . we have always approached that situation from a very critical angle .
we have also always said , however , that the conflict in Chechnya must be solved peacefully .
I heard today that there was another attack this morning in the north of Chechnya , when a suicide squad drove a truck into a government building .
more than thirty people are reported dead .
Mr President , I should like to ask you , in your role as President of the European Parliament , to express our condolences to the families of the deceased , and also to the local authorities , whilst emphasising strongly that this House deplores the use of any kind of violence to solve the conflict in Chechnya , and that we wish to take the path of negotiation .
the next item is the joint debate on the following draft resolutions on Taiwan &apos;s observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly :
B5 @-@ 0240 / 2003 by Ole Andreasen , Bob van den Bos and Graham R. Watson , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on Taiwan &apos;s observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly ;
B5 @-@ 0245 / 2003 by Brigitte Langenhagen and Georg Jarzembowski , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on Taiwan &apos;s observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly ;
B5 @-@ 0248 / 2003 by Per Gahrton , Joost Lagendijk and Nelly Maes , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on Taiwan &apos;s observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly ;
B5 @-@ 0254 / 2003 by Margrietus J. van den Berg , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on Taiwan &apos;s observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly ;
B5 @-@ 0261 / 2003 by Gerard Collins , on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , on Taiwan &apos;s observer status at the 56th World Health Assembly .
. ( FR ) Since being elected to the European Parliament , I have heard a lot about the Members &apos; Statute .
I believe Mr Rothley and the Committee on Legal Affairs as a whole have devoted a lot of time and energy to it , too much in my view since I have the impression that , as with the statute for European political parties , it is really about money .
these are not the great breakthroughs in democracy that will bring the European Union closer to the citizens .
what is in fact the point of these proposals , since they amend a text of higher legal status and will therefore remain inapplicable ?
what is the point of this attempted standardisation that creates a rift between the elected representatives of the present 15 Member States , the new ones , the old ones , and those of the ten states that will be joining us in a year &apos;s time ?
many want a statute in order to improve an image tarnished by the abuses of a few .
unfortunately , nothing in this statute can be considered a real improvement in transparency .
but offering the representatives of the peoples of the Member States a European system that differs from national law will further widen the gap we are wanting to bridge .
that is why I voted against this draft statute .
. ( PT ) The essential problem of developing countries with regard to energy - in contrast to the situation in more developed countries - is not the replacement of current production sources with other , less polluting ones .
the essential problem is one of access to any sources of energy at all .
note that two thousand million citizens do not have access to electricity .
so in order to achieve the dual objective of democratising access to electricity without worsening the greenhouse effect , it is fundamental that we should support the transfer of technology and the financing of environmentally beneficial projects .
it is unacceptable that the European Union should send its most obsolete technology to developing countries .
I welcome the efforts made by the European Union at Johannesburg for there to be binding targets for renewable energies , and the initiatives launched at that summit to get businesses involved .
I believe the rapporteur has made an excellent contribution to this cooperative effort to share the best technologies .
Mr President , I wish to begin by apologising for Mr Bradbourn &apos;s absence from this debate .
due to health reasons he cannot join us and , therefore , I am reading , on his behalf , the speech he prepared earlier .
I know he is extremely proud of being the rapporteur for the Marco Polo Programme and is looking forward to its passing through Parliament later this week .
as he reiterated in committee earlier this month , he felt that the three institutions were not far from agreement , and a close inspection of the common position proves this .
indeed , from Parliament &apos;s perspective , the two outstanding points that he felt needed to be discussed were resolved in the informal trialogue .
due to the success of the informal trialogue he felt that there was no need for a new , lengthy debate on the programme , which passed unopposed through the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism at its last meeting .
as Mr Bradbourn has reiterated on many occasions during the formulation of this programme , it must strike a balance , and he firmly believes this common position would do just that .
to bury business in yet more red tape would , in his eyes , be completely the wrong approach , notwithstanding the need for efficient scrutiny of how the money is spent and how effective the programme is proving to be .
the common position will mean that the programme remains market @-@ driven , thus providing an excellent opportunity to show that the European Union is prepared to help not hinder business , as is often the case .
as I am sure you are all aware , the threshold issue is something Mr Bradbourn has been fighting for vehemently , not just on behalf of the numerous small and medium @-@ sized businesses in his own region of the West Midlands of England , but for SMEs in general , which , if it were not for these low thresholds would miss out entirely on funding which is there to help them achieve the goals of the programme .
as rapporteur , his view was that by lowering the thresholds companies could work together in putting forward innovative projects that would benefit transport and , indeed , industry as a whole .
by keeping the original thresholds , small businesses would have once again been ignored by Europe which , it would seem , is merely interested in showcase schemes which , while looking good , do not benefit the people who paid for them - us or the taxpayers .
the immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme are improving the environmental performance of the freight transport system and also reducing road congestion in albeit a relatively small way .
your rapporteur justifiably believes that this lowering of thresholds is extremely important in obtaining these goals .
his last point merely reinforces one of the main aims of this whole proposal : to reduce bottlenecks .
he agreed originally with the Commission that congestion threatens both the environment and the operational working of the whole freight transport sector .
he still feels it imperative that we concentrate on practical ways to defuse these bottlenecks , especially at ports .
regarding the implementation of this programme , the last thing Mr Bradbourn wants is to unnecessarily hold up the legislative process .
as you will all agree , this programme is not only another piece of legislation ; it is a significant signal to Europe &apos;s freight businesses that we can , and indeed we want , to help rather than hinder them .
the sooner the Marco Polo Programme becomes active , the better for Europe &apos;s transport sector .
thus , given the outcome of this common position and its unopposed endorsement from members of the Committee on Transport , the rapporteur , Mr Bradbourn , believes we can progress towards the second reading of the Marco Polo Programme without the need for wholesale change .
as a final remark , he would , however , reiterate the necessity of our open approach : the carrot rather than the stick , designed to encourage both the participation of , and leadership by , the business community .
I apologise again for Mr Bradbourn &apos;s unavoidable absence .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen - , as the High Representative , Mr Javier Solana , has just explained , the political situation in the Middle East has reached a very low point .
apart from the difficulty in implementing the Roadmap so as to find a way out of the dreadful situation in which the Middle East has been plunged for some time now , new threats are looming on the horizon .
instead of feeling sorry for ourselves , however , we must look to the future , find out why we have failed and take remedial action .
if we accept that the two @-@ state solution still has the widest support , despite the building of the wall , despite the settlement problem and despite the attacks by Hamas , then the Roadmap needs to be put back on track .
perhaps the gradual approach that has been chosen , whereby the toughest issues are left until last , should be rethought .
solving the difficult problems first - like refugees and territorial division - may help to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of peace .
best practice acquired throughout the world may shed some light on how to approach the non @-@ negotiable issues .
as Mr Menéndez del Valle has observed in his draft report , any peace plan depends on the honest commitment of both sides - and , I would add , of the international community - to implement it .
it is this commitment that currently seems to be lacking : we therefore have to re @-@ establish the political will to make the two @-@ state solution work .
on the Israeli side , polls show that the majority of the population favour the two @-@ state solution , although , according to many observers , a large part of the current Israeli Government will not accept the creation of a genuine Palestinian state on the West Bank .
this rejection of the two @-@ state solution and the failure to implement the Roadmap seem to be based on ideological reasons or on security fears .
building the wall , the security barrier , which runs deep inside the West Bank , is a consequence of both schools of thought , but it does not solve the concerns that lie at the root of either one .
both Palestinians and Israelis will , in fact , be left on both sides of the dividing line , many Palestinians will be subjected to great humanitarian suffering and some of the settlements will be left on the other side of the wall .
the European Union has always recognised Israel s right &quot; to defend itself , but security does not consist solely of preventing terrorists from carrying out their abhorrent attacks ; first and foremost , it is a matter of winning the people &quot; s hearts and minds .
building a wall may be an acceptable measure , provided it is kept within Israeli territory .
Israel now has to adopt a sufficient number of measures to strengthen trust .
all extrajudicial executions and all punitive demolition of homes must stop .
all outlying settlements on Palestinian land built since September 2000 must be pulled down , and all activities carried on in them must stop , since they are obstacles to the two @-@ state solution .
on the Palestinian side , the government seems to believe in the two @-@ state solution , which means accepting the creation of a Palestinian state on the 1967 land ; among the people and opposition groups , however , rejection of this solution is gaining ground .
Hamas and others do not recognise Israel s right &quot; to exist , as shown by the terrible suicide attacks and other terrorist acts .
in addition , there seems to be a growing lack of any ability , power or willingness to set up efficient institutions , especially in the security field .
the new government under Prime Minister Abu Ala must take effective control of the Palestinian territories , undertake clear action against those who organise and commit violent attacks on the Israeli population , and publicly reaffirm Israel &quot; s right to exist .
it is equally important to make resolute progress on preparing for the elections , drafting the constitution and involving civil society in the reforms .
it is understandable that the international community should be focusing its attention on the security issue , but we must not forget the need to strengthen institutions and undertake reforms .
this is an important aspect , and we should not lose sight of it .
having institutions that work well is the basis for long @-@ term stability and security for both Palestine and Israel .
the international community should be more decisive in setting targets against which the results achieved by both parties can be measured , in effectively monitoring all areas and not just that of security , and in offering rapid , effective support from donors .
is there any hope ?
both Israelis and Palestinians have to be persuaded that they have something to gain by moving on from today &quot; s terrible situation .
both sides have signed up to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to a guarantee of secure borders for the state of Israel , not to mention full acceptance of Israel by all countries in the region .
the international community must now do everything it can to persuade , coax and put pressure on both sides to honour the commitments they have made .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks and congratulations go to Mrs Hermange for an excellent report .
it is extremely important that the Hague Convention on parental responsibility and the protection of children , which dates back to 1996 , is ratified by the rest of the Member States as quickly as possible .
the Hague Convention and , in particular , the Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility , which was adopted at the beginning of the month by the Member States of the European Union , will be a considerable help in settling disputes on custody within Europe .
in Europe we have actually acquired an instrument to help us to reach swift and effective decisions in disputes over custody and enable us to avoid long , expensive and difficult legal proceedings with regard to separations across borders , which are so painful for children .
we can really ensure that children grow up in a calm environment .
I am glad and a little surprised to see just how excellent a reception the Regulation has had throughout Europe .
both the press and children &quot; s organisations have together commended us on what we have achieved .
divorce is always a traumatic experience for a child , as it is for adults too , and if it is followed by litigation that lasts for years it can become absolutely intolerable .
with this Regulation the EU will have , for the first time , an instrument by means of which conflicts arising from different laws in different Member States can be avoided .
of course we cannot meddle with the content of the Hague Convention in this report by Mrs Hermange .
for that reason , I wish to ask whether the Commission and the Council are aware that the biggest problems are in any case disputes over the custody and the abduction of children when one of the parents comes from outside the EU and a country that has not ratified the Hague Convention .
we have all read sad stories in the tabloid press about children being abducted , a harrowing experience for parents and the playmates of the children involved .
could the European Union itself have a hand in promoting the ratification of the Hague Convention ?
could the Commission and the Council try to negotiate more bilateral agreements so that the Hague Convention might be signed in still more countries ?
we would achieve even better results if we could involve countries outside the EU in this same arrangement that now allows us to deal with custody disputes within the Union .
- Although I applaud the way in which the rapporteur has clarified the goal of the regulation for Asia and Latin America , the question concerning the fight against poverty is this : where is the added value compared to national development cooperation ?
in the fight against poverty , there is the risk of Member States duplicating their efforts .
the regulation &apos;s purpose could therefore be indicated more clearly .
in terms of developing trading capacity , the complementary aspect is clear .
it is complementary to development cooperation and related to European trade policy .
secondly , the biregional Solidarity Fund proposed in the report is undesirable .
a fund must have well @-@ defined objectives .
solidarity suggests a sense of involvement among people that takes shape within social contexts , close to the citizen and based on an internal conscience : think of the charity taught by Christ .
however , in an inter @-@ continental context , this charitableness finds expression via specific policy actions and co @-@ financing organisations .
a solidarity fund is not appropriate here .
I would , by the way , thank the rapporteur , my compatriot , for her efforts for a good cause .
Mr President , I would like to thank all the Members of this House who have signed this declaration .
we are dealing here with three separate aspects : cruelty , consumer fraud and recently we discovered that these pelts are toxic as well .
the majority of Council Ministers at the meeting in November agreed to a ban .
the majority of Members of this House have agreed to a ban .
the majority of the citizens of the European Union want a ban .
it is now up to the Commission to impose a ban .
I hope that the willingness of the House to support this is being listened to by the Commission .
for any other Members who wish to join in this success story , the declaration will remain open for 20 minutes after this sitting !
thank you , Mr President .
I would like to thank the honourable Members for their speeches and , firstly , I would like to thank Mrs Maes for the work she is doing as rapporteur on the safety of third @-@ country aircraft .
I hope that we can have a conciliation quickly and that this accident will serve to make us speed up and overcome certain reservations and difficulties which arose in the Council in relation to the points which I referred to earlier , whether those relating to speedy transposition into national laws or those relating to greater transparency with regard to the stringency and quality of safety and the state of maintenance of the aircraft by the different air companies operating in the European Union .
I believe that there is a middle ground between Parliament &quot; s initial proposal - which was perhaps too exhaustive and - not providing any information at all , and clearly the Commission supports , as I said in my first speech , an increase in transparency regarding the true situation of the aircraft of air companies , that is to say , stringency in the monitoring of safety standards .
as well as this issue , I would like to refer very briefly to the fact that there are certain issues which have yet to be promoted over the next few years , but the implementation of the European Civil Aviation Safety Agency is an extremely important step forward .
when we adopt this legislation on third @-@ country aircraft , we will be taking an extremely important step forward .
within the International Civil Aviation Organisation we must strengthen its controls , since , in principle , the control of how activities are carried out in the different States with regard to their aircraft falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation .
in other words , it would not be a question of the European Civil Aviation Agency going to a third country to check how they carry out their work and their controls there .
this task falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation .
it is a different thing for the European Union to have competence to ensure that the aircraft which land in our territory comply with the requirements and that we control how the requirements are complied with by those aircraft .
we must take an additional step forward , so that , at Community level , there are common rules , to the effect that if a country prohibits overflight or landing by certain aircraft , that that rule should be extended to the whole of the European Union s airspace . &quot;
that if a country detects a particular kind of problem in a specific aircraft , it will be obligatory for that information to be distributed and passed on to all the countries of the Union ; and also that there be common rules on the way in which those controls are carried out , on the percentage and on the system .
we must reach agreements which guarantee that the whole of the Union takes appropriate measures and that they are applicable throughout our airspace .
the next point which has arisen is the transfer of passenger data to the United States .
I would like to clarify something which Mrs Ainardi has said , and that is that the United States are not requesting the sensitive information the honourable Member has mentioned .
the information classed as sensitive in accordance with the Directive on data protection in Europe health - , religion and so on - is not being requested by the United States .
this is what the honourable Member must be aware of .
it is not that information which is going to be communicated .
the next issue relates to the communication of data .
I can tell honourable Members that we have reached an agreement which the Commission believes provides for protection of the privacy of our citizens , because , as has been said before - I believe it was Mr Poignant - there is tension between the safety component &apos; &quot; and the privacy component &apos; . &quot;
we must resolve the tension between the two elements in an appropriate and balanced way .
we have reached an agreement - amongst other things , thanks to this Parliament , let us make this very clear which - in the end includes a series of guarantees which the European Union was demanding - a reduction in the amount of data , the type of data , a restriction in terms of the objective for which they will be used , a restriction of the time for which they can be used , in other words , all the elements which the honourable Members are perfectly aware of - which means that we can say that , by means of this agreement , the fundamental rights which our legislation affords our citizens are guaranteed , also in terms of the way the United States uses the information , while at the same time we are helping and cooperating in the improvement of safety in the air sector and the fight against international terrorism .
I believe that all of this responds essentially to the elements which have been raised here .
I would like once again to thank this Parliament for its cooperation in the different steps we have taken .
I believe they have been extremely important .
we can bring them to a conclusion speedily through this Directive on the safety of third @-@ country aircraft , and , ladies and gentlemen , I would like once again to express our condolences for the victims and say that we must continue to work to improve safety in the air sector , firstly , naturally , in European airspace , in relation to aircraft which leave Europe for other places , but also at world level , because , however much information we provide - and naturally we must do so , to increase transparency in the information tour operators give their clients , stating which company is going to provide the transport , stating exactly which companies they work with - this is important and will improve safeguards and information for our citizens and our passengers , and there can be no doubt that we Europeans - or non @-@ Europeans - must fight to improve safety in air traffic and in international civil aviation .
. Mr President , Commissioner - , ladies and gentlemen , it was in the 1990s that the great UN conferences gave new impetus to international cooperation and in particular to the relations between the poor and the wealthy countries in the world .
among them was the Cairo Conference on Population and Development , held in September 1994 .
its tenth anniversary , which is almost upon us , cannot fail to be an occasion for drawing up a review of what has become of the ambitious Programme of Action , which the considerable number of 179 states voted to adopt .
if I may anticipate the rest of my speech , the result is somewhat disappointing when measured against the claims made for it then .
it was in Cairo that population development was first bracketed with global development and core development policy objectives , whereas population growth had formerly been dealt with as a wholly separate issue , and birth control and family planning had not been considered in relation to society as a whole .
doing this for the first time was Cairo s principal achievement . &quot;
it chose as its primary objectives the eradication of poverty , sustainable economic growth , educational opportunities for all population groups , especially for girls and women , gender equality and equal rights for men and women , protection , support and encouragement for the family , facilitation of general access to reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services , and a reduction in infant , child and maternal mortality rates .
the Cairo Action Programme placed the right - and I emphasise the right - to reproductive health and family planning at the heart of a new understanding of population policy , and so it is on this that my report focuses .
it will be clear from the appended statistics how dire is the situation of women in developing countries as regards their reproductive health and the continuing high death rates among infants , children and their mothers .
let me give you some details of the misery of women around the world . every year , one million women die as a result of infections of the reproductive organs , including sexually transmitted diseases , but excluding HIV / Aids .
every minute , though , ten people are infected with the HIV virus , half of them being under 24 years of age .
every minute , a woman dies as a result of complications associated with pregnancy .
every year , 175 million women become pregnant , and , of those , at least 75 million do not want to be .
every minute , some 100 pregnancies are terminated , 40 of them unsafely carried out by persons with no medical training .
every year , 70 000 women die as a result of botched terminations .
let me say , for the avoidance of misunderstanding , that termination of pregnancy cannot , of course , be a family planning method , but if women are in dire need and have no other way out , then they must be enabled to have a safe termination .
according to a well @-@ known African doctor , &apos; If as many young men were dying each day , about 1 450 per day or 529 000 per year , from causes that were largely preventable , it would be a matter for the Security Council &quot; The risks involved , though , are far from equal .
in developing countries , complications arising from pregnancy and birth are the main cause of death and disablement for women of child @-@ bearing age .
to put it another way , the risk of dying during pregnancy or as a result of it is 150 times greater for women south of the Sahara than it is for women in Europe .
in Denmark , a woman dies for this reason every four months ; in Afghanistan , it is every 26 minutes .
I could give many other comparisons .
these data should throw into relief the urgent need for action across the board , to which the signatory states at Cairo committed themselves to the tune of billions .
most of them have failed to follow this commitment through ; not even one @-@ half of the sum promised has actually been produced , although the developing countries have , in percentage terms , done more to meet the targets than have the countries of the North .
the United Kingdom has just given us a good example of how to do it by increasing from GBP 4.5 million to GBP 6 million its funding per annum for the UN s family planning programme . &quot;
this is also a response to President Bush &quot; s restrictive policy , which has sparked protests around the world .
recently too , the Commission on Population and Development of the United Nations Economic and Social Council , ECOSOC , has also come to the conclusion , looking back at Cairo , that population and reproductive health are highly important issues that must therefore form part of development programmes and strategies to combat poverty , and that this would be the only way to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
that is in line with the conclusions in my report , which are addressed to the Commission , for European development cooperation , too , must actively help every couple and every individual to avail themselves of the fundamental right to good health and the free exercise of their own responsibility in determining the number of children they will have and the age at which they will have them .
for over 90 years , the International Women s Day &quot; has been a day of political campaigning for women s rights . &quot;
in Europe , too , there is - as we have heard - still much to be done , but we European sisters must admit that we are lamenting from something of a great height ; what we have achieved , most women in developing countries can only dream of .
international Women s Day &quot; must make us more aware of the need for international solidarity .
the message of my report on Cairo ten years on to the women of the South is that their European sisters are standing alongside them .
even there , the rays of hope are multiplying .
which of the world s parliaments &quot; do you think has the highest proportion of women members ?
Finland s &quot; ?
Sweden s &quot; ?
neither has anything to be ashamed of , but Rwanda s , &quot; with over 48 % , does better than either .
this gives us grounds for hope .
Mr President , in my contribution , I should like to focus on Romania , and I have three reasons for doing so .
the first is that the present discussion on Romania is , in my view , the best possible barometer of the current enlargement round .
indeed , what is evident from this discussion is that the main problems in the new Member States are not related to the fisheries chapter or the transport chapter , important and interesting though these may be .
the most persistent problems in the new Member States have to do with the functioning of the constitutional state , the independence of the judiciary and freedom of expression of opinion .
this brings me to my second reason , provided that other Members allow me to carry on , Mr President , for noise levels are rather high at the moment .
the discussion on Romania is also of major importance for future enlargement rounds including Turkey and the Balkans , and for the reason that we cannot very well insist in Ankara and Zagreb on an improvement of human rights or the rights of minorities if , at the same time , we allow the situation in Bucharest to remain at a standstill and , in fact , to change for the worse in a number of respects .
so to my third point , which is that the situation in Romania itself remains problematic .
to this day , the reform of the constitutional state is in its infancy .
to this day , it is impossible for critical journalists to do their jobs .
to this day , corruption is an enormous problem right up to the highest political level .
in her report , Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne is right to take a critical view of this .
to the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I would say that advocates of enlargement , even more than its opponents , have a duty to be critical , and they must also remain so .
it is encouraging to see , Mr President , that precisely this critical stance is bearing fruit .
over the past few days , the Romanian Government has announced new reforms and accelerated the old ones .
the Justice Minister has had to step down because he is held responsible for the stagnation .
I would urge the Romanian Government to carry on with the reforms , for if it does not , it may as well forget about joining in 2007 .
my appeal to NGOs and journalists is to carry on with their critical work and keep us informed .
Mr President , the European Union is good at influencing countries by dangling a carrot in front of them , but sometimes an educational rap on the knuckles does wonders too .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President , Mrs Maes , Mr Stockmann , Commission staff , ladies and gentlemen , we are indeed a cosy huddle of experts .
my group endorses the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation that the Common Position be adopted .
we would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work with the Council behind the scenes .
it is important to bring this matter to a conclusion .
Commissioner , Madam Vice @-@ President , I think it is essential that in reforming the Slot Regulation , we agree on the new definition of slots as usage rights . a slot only entitles carriers to use airport facilities for takeoffs and landings at specified dates and times .
these usage rights do not represent any kind of property right , neither to airports , nor to air carriers . slots are a general good .
I am most grateful to you , Madam Vice @-@ President , for stating that you will endeavour to present a revised version of the new Regulation by November .
I personally believe - and here , I follow the line adopted by the rapporteur in his report - that it is essential to make it very clear that slots do not belong to the airport or to airlines , which means that they cannot be traded .
we can devise all sorts of trading rules and amendments , but let me say this : the British Airways slots at Heathrow are not British Airways property that can be traded for generous sums of money .
the slots are a general good - in Frankfurt , Paris or at any other airport .
I am most grateful that the Council , Parliament and the Commission have agreed to strengthen the role and independence of coordinators , for the coordinators &apos; role is to ensure the effective use of airports and airspace in the common interest , not to create advantages or disadvantages for the airlines or airports .
the aim must be to ensure the best possible use of the airports for airlines and passengers in economic and environmental terms .
I am therefore grateful to Mr Stockmann for concluding this matter successfully before the end of this legislative period . we should all vote in favour of his report tomorrow .
Madam President , Commissioner De Palacio , Mr Mombaur , Mr Seppänen , last June the European Union adopted , with difficulty and well behind time in relation to consumers &quot; and European companies &quot; needs , Directive 2003 / 55 / EC which takes decisive steps towards the completion of the liberalisation of the gas market .
in order to overcome the remaining obstacles to the completion of the internal market , the Member States established a system of informal coordination between , on the one hand , Community and national institutions , and on the other , companies and regulatory authorities in the gas sector , seeking to lay down guidelines on third party access to transmission networks .
nevertheless , this informal coordination has proved to be inadequate to address the severe delays which have built up until now ; indeed , the interests in undertakings of various countries and the privileges of position which many gas supply undertakings continue to gain from , have seriously jeopardised the possibility of completing a single market in the gas supply sector .
we should therefore welcome the Commission s initiative &quot; proposing the regulation which we must debate today , which makes the operating rules clearer and binding and responds to consumers &quot; and companies needs &quot; for certainty and rapidity .
the text put forward by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy further strengthens this proposal and I therefore believe that it should be supported as it stands .
it is in the interest of certain countries - Italy in particular - with a high consumption of natural gas , insufficient national production and a strong , growing dependence on imports , which require several countries to be crossed , to have certain rules which signify , in operational terms , a real opportunity to have a market and , consequently , a system of liberalised networks which make gas available to companies and consumers in the required amounts , with freedom of choice .
Mr President , on the first question of whether this Commission should have left the issue for the next Commission , I wish to say that this whole issue goes back to 1998 , when a directive was adopted on the protection of designs .
at that time no agreement could be reached on the issue of spare parts for cars and the matter was put on hold .
however , it was agreed that any change in legislation should go in the direction of liberalisation .
that is what we have done today .
secondly , in 2002 my colleague , Mr Monti , convinced the Commission and others of the need to liberalise the distribution of cars , which is called block exemption .
this was done , and this proposal is the natural concomitant of his proposal , which was adopted in 2002 .
therefore , it was of the essence that this Commission should deal with this issue because , as I have said , it goes with his proposal .
I therefore insisted that this Commission should deal with it .
moreover , I think the Member who has just spoken would agree that it would not do for this Commission - even though it is within six weeks of the end of its term of office - to pass on difficult decisions to the next Commission .
we are paid to take decisions - even though they may be difficult - and we should do that .
the second point refers to employment .
at the moment car manufacturers obtain spare parts beyond and outside the European Union .
they buy bonnets , headlamps and rear windows in countries like Turkey , Brazil and Korea .
in other words , at the moment car manufacturers have exported jobs to those countries .
if we open the market for repairs and the secondary market for spare parts , it is more than likely that the jobs created by small and medium @-@ sized enterprises - which , we all agree , are very important for industry in general and in particular for German industry - will more than compensate for the loss of jobs as car manufacturers have been outsourcing their components - their spare parts - to suppliers beyond the confines of the European Union .
although it is difficult to point to hard facts , I am confident that the net result will be positive for employment , since I expect these small- and medium @-@ sized enterprises to become very successful in the secondary market for spare parts .
thank you very much , Mr President .
I shall try to make good use of the time .
I should like to thank the Minister for also coming to the Committee on Foreign Affairs to tell us about the steps about to be taken to help in this situation .
after listening to all this , I shall anxiously await next week s Security Council decision &quot; and the decision of the UN plenary session with respect to this situation , so that the European Union will then also be able to make its own independent decisions as regards its own further measures .
I believe that the horrors of which we have heard cannot be resolved by simply increasing the aid resources allocated to these people in order to provide for their basic needs for survival , but that there is a real need to attempt to settle these matters through economic pressure on the government .
a joint approach by all the organisations which might be able to help here involves treaties with the African Union or the UN and also with the United States .
I shall keep my fingers crossed that a decision will be taken as soon as possible on behalf of these unfortunate people .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are all agreed that this attack in Beslan was monstrous , and that those who perpetrated it showed themselves to be monsters by taking children hostage and demanding that their mothers should decide which children should die and which should survive .
taking that as our starting point , there are two options open to us : we can say that these monsters must be fought , which is a self @-@ evident truism but rather simplistic , or we can ask ourselves how human beings could become monsters .
the Chechens who carried out this operation were not born monsters , but became them .
who made human beings into monsters ?
that is a legitimate question , and , in Chechnya , a colonial power has for years been waging a colonial war that , day after day , brings forth monsters .
if we want to talk about how to put a stop to the barbarities of terrorism , we have to start by looking at how to put a stop to the barbarities of this colonial war .
history has taught us what colonial wars are like .
the atrocities committed by the Algerians against the French were barbaric .
colonial wars bring forth barbarians .
the problem is with finding a way to end the barbarism , and here it is not enough to say that we are going to pour more money into the war on terrorism ; we have to ask what we Europeans are going to put into the political balance in order to put a stop to the barbarism .
in this context , the role we can play is that of political mediator between the Russians , who are incapable of coming up with a political solution , and the Chechens , who cannot extricate themselves from terrorism .
that is why we call for a condemnation of Putin .
what does the reform of the regional election process have to do with terrorism , or with the fight against it ?
nothing .
it does , however , have something to do with the power of a tsar whose democratic legitimacy is dubious .
the Russia of today - it has to be said - is in the process of leaving democracy behind .
turning to Chechnya , when there is talk of a political solution , we have to know with whom one is supposed to negotiate .
a political solution will not be found in Russia alone ; there must be partners on the Chechen side with whom it is possible to negotiate .
if everyone - the terrorists and the Chechens who propose political solutions - is treated in the same way , that is to say , as terrorists , there will be no political solution , because there will be nobody to negotiate with .
negotiations will have to involve Mr Zakayev , they will have to involve discussing his proposals and recognising him , and it is only right that the European Union should recognise him and prompt him to abandon and denounce terrorism ; he has to be treated as a political partner , as an enemy with whom it is necessary to negotiate .
negotiations are always conducted with enemies and never with friends .
with friends , one organises surprise parties , if one feels in the mood for them ; one does not conduct political negotiations with them .
it is for that reason , Mr President , that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is proposing Natalia Estemirova for the Sakharov Prize .
the daughter of a Russian father and Chechen mother , she is in Grozny fighting the good fight for the recognition of human rights : a symbol in herself !
she is a member of the Memorial group &apos; &quot; that produced Andrei Sakharov , in whose spirit , and with whose friends , she campaigns .
I hope that this House will find the strength to say that there is a solution other than terrorism to the conflict in Chechnya , and Natalia Estemirova would be the symbol of political action on its part in the face of this tragic situation .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , investing means having confidence .
when we do not have confidence , we do not invest .
so what are our reasons ?
I cannot condone your presence in the Azores .
since then we have found out that the war in Iraq was based on a lie and , to use an expression which has been used a lot , do not forget the Ten Commandments .
to lie is a sin : with a grain of repentance on this issue , you could have earned a tiny bit of neutrality from quarters other than those which are supporting you today .
secondly , the team : everything possible has been said about the team , or almost .
you could have won a grain of confidence if you had changed part of it .
you announce an agency , but you keep the money .
that is of no use to anybody .
Clemenceau , in France , used to say : &apos; when I want to bury a problem , I create a commission . &quot;
I have the impression that we can already express our condolences .
and then there is your orientation .
you could have sent a small signal to the left of this House by saying : more public services in order to counterbalance competition ;
even with the Commission you propose , you could have made a few gestures .
you have not done so , and you will therefore not have neutrality .
Mr President , I represent a party that entered Parliament this year .
we do not believe that we can approve the 2005 budget .
we believe that the expenditure is too high , with the commitments amounting to 1.14 % of gross domestic income .
this budget should form the basis for future financial planning , and we believe that it could have been more restrictive .
there are many areas in which savings could have been made .
that being said , we of course have nothing against re @-@ prioritising within the framework set up by the Commission and the Council . there are many instances of re @-@ prioritising for which there are good reasons .
we naturally think , however , that it is important for strict limits to be placed upon agricultural subsidies . as Mrs Schreyer said , these constitute 55 % of the budget , and that is quite unreasonable .
I know that it is not in accordance with the Treaty , but our development proposal involves , of course , reducing agricultural subsidies considerably and instead using the money for new initiatives .
we argue in favour of a percentage of gross domestic income as our objective . this is not a block on reform , but a demand for re @-@ prioritisation .
nor do we think that the Lisbon strategy should be the basis for trying to procure significantly increased expenditure by the EU .
we believe , in accordance with the subsidiarity principle , that growth is a supremely national issue that is not promoted by increased EU expenditure and taxes .
that is not the route to increased growth .
we therefore reject the very cornerstone of the thinking behind the budget .
I shall not go into all the details of the re @-@ prioritising .
all that must be discussed .
we need a much clearer link between those who propose expenditure and those who have responsibility for arranging the funding and collecting taxpayers money . &quot;
to me , it seems as if Parliament is pushing for expenditure without accepting the political responsibility for demanding further tax revenue .
in the long term , it is not a good division of labour to have one body that proposes expenditure and another whose task it is to obtain the money .
that is from where the tensions arise .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first I should like to express my thanks for the report .
I should like to speak on two matters : the first concerns Lisbon .
the European social model can certainly be combined with competitiveness , cohesion and solidarity , which are not mere buzzwords but need to be transformed into political actions .
to this end the results will have to be assessed in practical terms and our great ambitions must not be abandoned .
the main road , I must insist , is the one that leads on firmly towards training , schools and research , to give everyone the means to grow and to take part in active citizenship , so that social protection does not turn into a benefits culture .
the second matter concerns citizens &quot; Europe , which is having difficulty in taking off and certainly requires a great effort on our part in the area of communications .
if , however , we do not want it to remain a mere statement of intention , we must support it with adequate funding within our budget , and the Constitutional Treaty can certainly provide some valuable momentum .
thank you , Mr President , first of all , I would like to note that our colleague Mr Eurlings has carried out an enormous task and deserves our acknowledgement and gratitude .
having analysed Mr Eurlings &apos; report , it is obvious that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria today , that is , it is not capable of passing the tests which had to be overcome by those European Union Member States which became members of the club after 1993 , that is , after the Copenhagen criteria had been laid down .
while listening to the speeches which propose that Turkey be recognised as ready to start European Union membership negotiations , in spite of the violation of minority rights , basic human rights and freedoms in Turkey , one is reminded of George Orwell &apos;s Animal Farm &apos; &quot; ; an order where everybody is equal , but some are more equal .
in other words , we are showing double standards as regards further European Union expansion .
this is largely due to the fact that the state which is seeking full European Union membership , but failing to meet the requirements , has a powerful advocate .
maybe we are ready to review , to revise the Copenhagen criteria , to lower the level of requirements ?
Turkey today maybe another Eurasian state tomorrow , for example Russia ?
the economic aspect of Turkey s European Union membership &quot; is also important .
the former European Commissioner for the Internal Market warned that the European Union will explode if it does not reform agricultural and regional policies .
the European Union &apos;s ability to absorb new members and overcome the economic challenges of European Union expansion are not infinite .
extensive European Union expansion undoubtedly has limits and it would be wiser to consolidate the consequences of the most recent European Union expansion , to evaluate the economic results of Romania and Bulgaria joining the European Union , as well as forecast the economic consequences of Ukraine and Moldova s European aspirations , &quot; that is , matters which should be our priority .
therefore , I believe that it would be in the European Union &apos;s interests to have a privileged partnership with Turkey .
Mr President , for the Catalan Republican Left the and - - for the other parties in our European coalition - for example from the Basque country , Aragon and Andalusia this - is not a good Constitutional Treaty .
it does not recognise our wish for internal enlargement .
stateless nations will not have any recognition in this Treaty .
we would have accepted the Treaty if only it had included a small step forward official @-@ language status - for the Catalan language .
today , in Parliament , about 2 % of Members may not speak their mother tongue .
of this 2 % , the vast majority of us are Catalan speakers .
I am the fourth Catalan @-@ speaking Member - after President Borrell , Mr Guardans Cambó and Mr Hammerstein Mintz - to speak here this morning in a language other than our own -
we reject this constitutional Treaty because we want to be directly involved in Europe and want a stronger , more united and cohesive Europe , built on its own diversity ; just the opposite of a nation @-@ state built on the basis of the French model and against plurilingualism , diversity and plurinationality .
working nation @-@ states do not make a good basis for the construction of Europe .
Europe should be built on the basis of national diversity comprising stateless nations , nation @-@ states and constitutional regions , for the purpose of establishing a new European citizenship .
- I want to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his answers to the questions put by Mr Hughes on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
the matter has been discussed several times in that committee , but it has in actual fact also been discussed in the Committee on Budgets in which we perhaps had to approach it at a rather more difficult angle , given that we also , of course , wanted to see administration that was as efficient and inexpensive as possible .
when , as justification for this dismissal of the 43 teachers , the Commission refers to considerations of sound financial management and the need to ensure both that the costs do not get badly out of hand and that the language courses are obtainable at a third or fourth of the former price , it is difficult for people involved with the budget not to say that the decision is apparently a sensible one .
that is why we in the Committee on Budgets have paid attention first and foremost to the way in which matters have proceeded .
the administration must of course be efficient and inexpensive and , in recent years , we in Parliament have exerted considerable pressure to ensure that the Commission implements reforms and that , through these reforms , a more open and transparent system is obtained , which also means a system that is perhaps better in tune with the world around us .
there is of course a general prejudice among our electorate that Commission employees are very cosseted , privileged and highly paid , and we must therefore do our best to ensure that remuneration is reasonable and that things are not bought at a higher price than they need to be .
that is an important point of departure .
that being said , I would point out that the Commission should also be an attractive place of work and should also comply with the current ground rules designed to protect employees .
we have been assured that the Belgian rules have been complied with .
I presume that this fact is reflected in the compensation that has been given to the teachers and which , according to the Commissioner , is apparently by far the most generous ever seen .
that no doubt also reflects the fact that matters have not proceeded properly in this case .
as Mr Hughes has pointed out , the Commission must also comply with some of the requirements we make of employers outside the confines of the Commission .
the Commission too must demonstrate social responsibility and sound management .
I would therefore recommend that an amicable solution be found regarding this matter , thus ensuring that it is properly resolved .
ways should also , however , be looked into of ensuring , in the future , proper administration that complies with the requirements of the law , is inexpensive and is suitably in keeping with the organisation s social responsibility . &quot;
Mr President , it is a great pleasure to be here for my first debate with you in plenary , and the subject could not have been better chosen .
it is no coincidence that today &apos;s agenda started with the Commission working paper .
the President of the Commission underlined how important the work programme is for this term of the Commission .
Mr Frattini took the lead by explaining the priority we attach to criminal matters and justice .
and now it is for me as Competition Commissioner to explain our position on what is in Mr Jonathan Evans &apos; report .
I welcome the support of the European Parliament , and I acknowledge the support you have given in the past to the European Commission , and especially to Mr Monti , as you rightly emphasise .
there is no doubt that I have inherited a great legacy from Mr Monti .
the greatest tribute I can pay him is to continue his work and build on it .
under the leadership of President Barroso , the European Commission has recently proposed a new partnership for growth and jobs .
competition policy , as Mr Evans rightly mentioned , has a crucial role to play here .
competition is the central driving @-@ force for competitiveness and growth , and we badly need that growth .
that was clearly stated this afternoon by speakers from both right and left .
if we are to deliver on the fundamental social and environmental objectives which are at the heart of our European values , then economic growth is a must .
there are three ways competition policy can contribute to partnership .
firstly , later this spring we will launch a debate on reviewing the state aid rules within the overall objective of &apos; less and better &apos; , which here means better focused aid .
aid should be concentrated where it can add most value : for innovation , research and development , risk capital and the development of those regions lagging furthest behind .
secondly , we will maintain a fair and firm approach to enforcement and will remain tough on cartels .
there is no doubt about that . that was also Mr Monti &apos;s approach .
as the report highlights , it is not acceptable to let the global advantages of the single market be undermined by cartels and other unfair business practices among a handful of undertakings .
thirdly , we will look at new ways of promoting competition in the internal market , by using sector investigations and competition screening to uncover and tackle the remaining , often hidden , regulatory and private barriers to free competition .
in taking these priorities forward , I will take account of the helpful observations presented in the report before us .
I can assure you of my commitment to ensuring an ongoing and constructive dialogue on competition issues with this House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the maintenance and promotion of cultural diversity is an important task both within and outside the European Union , one to which this House has always given political priority .
this issue touches upon the most important democratic values freedom - of opinion , tolerance and dialogue between cultures among others - values deserving of protection .
the convention under discussion is an important instrument of international cooperation in safeguarding these cultural values .
in order to hold our own on the international stage , we need a mandate , and we need our position to be beyond any doubt .
globalisation is a threat to cultural diversity and media pluralism .
to the national governments , too , this convention gives a legal framework for taking measures necessary to the protection - and , where necessary , also the promotion - of cultural diversity .
contrary to what we are often told , it is not a protectionist instrument ; nor is it a blank cheque .
it does , however , improve the international exchange of cultural goods , and fosters diversity .
this is not about us going on a crusade against the WTO or - to put it bluntly - against America .
we simply want the convention and the WTO and GATS negotiations to complement each other .
what we have at the moment is something like the battle between David and Goliath .
this is about strengthening David so that he may prevail in this battle , which is being fought in the interests of the cultural diversity that we have to protect , and it is for that reason that we need to agree on a common approach within UNESCO , so that we may prevail in the GATS and WTO negotiations .
I want to underline what Mrs Hieronymi and Mrs Trüpel said : within the European Union , too , we have to ensure that the services directive does not apply to audiovisual materials .
Mr President , we are about to witness a historic moment : for the first time in Europe , the European Parliament is in a position to pass such a resolution , and we shall cast our votes tomorrow .
the European Union , the European Parliament and every other body that controls , passes and amends regulations often criticises human rights outside the EU s borders . &quot;
on the other hand , it is a historic moment , because this is the first document that criticises human rights within the EU , with regard to Romas .
this type of political mood , developing in Parliament for the first time in its history , is significant because discrimination against the Roma within the EU no longer needs to be a taboo subject .
today , the disability index is 60 % on average in the twenty @-@ five Member States .
this means that on average , 60 % of children who are declared mentally disabled are Roma .
we have not only forfeited the child s chance &quot; of further education , but also put him or her in a situation that he or she will never be able to get out of , and thus we practically seal the child &quot; s fate at age seven .
housing problems , dislodgement , compulsory sterilisation , segregated labour rooms , and numerous other means of discriminatory cases that even the resolution lists in various paragraphs , are not at all surprising within the EU and I deliberately do not mention specific countries here .
promoting political participation is another important role of the Union , the deficiency of which is dealt with significantly in some paragraphs .
today , Roma population in the EU is approximately 7 @-@ 8 million with only two representatives here in Parliament based on our ethnic origin .
I am very proud of my country , as both of us come from Hungary .
however , there are no other Roma political representatives from any other country in the Commission , or in any other EU institution .
this participation gap must be closed , not only in the EU , which is mainly our task , but also on the level of national governments , so that in addition to EU directives and guidelines that define the strategic policies of individual countries in this matter , the national governments should also feel that this responsibility is shared by every part of society in all of Europe .
it is not up to the Roma to solve this issue , since it is not they who consider that their children are disabled ; it is not Roma women who want to have their ovaries cut out .
according to public opinion polls , it is in Europe where Romas feel most European .
this statement is not at all surprising , as Roma people are no longer able to believe their own government in any country , especially in Central Eastern Europe .
term after term , different political parties keep replacing each other , but none of the governing political parties have been able to provide a solution to this problem and eliminate discrimination , for instance .
the only hope of the Romas lies in the European Union and European Parliament , where we all sit , trying to pass a resolution with tomorrow s &quot; vote .
I trust that our decision regarding the situation of the Roma will set a real standard for human rights .
dear colleagues , I still would like to come back to the history of the Romany Gypsies .
the present and its problems always have a connection to the past that we need to know . in particular , when it is about human tragedies , which followed the greatest Jewish tragedy , that are , however , forgotten , since they are the tragedies of smaller nations , such as the genocide of the Romany or Chechen @-@ Ingush people carried out during the Second World War , and the Chechen genocide last year was acknowledged by the European Parliament .
a week ago I visited a small exhibition in our Parliament that moved me .
it seems this has already been discussed here .
that was the former Romany concentration camp , Lety , in the present Czech Republic , at those times under Nazi occupation .
few exhibits , but they cannot leave one untouched .
for example , that picture which is here - tens of small , lovely and merry children , obviously , black @-@ haired and black @-@ eyed , who are most probably condemned to death .
and in the former camp buildings there is neither a museum nor a memorial place to respect the sufferings , but a piggery .
nobody would dare to treat the barracks of Auschwitz in this way ; therefore , here we have unequal opportunities as well , even if we talk differently .
I ask my colleagues from the Czech Republic to do their best to change the present situation at Lety .
thank you .
Madam President , Mr Cercas , working time is an extremely sensitive issue .
the reasons for this include the scourge of unemployment and the economic problems faced by employers , particularly in the new Member States .
a few days ago I was astonished to find that people in Poland were able to go shopping in Ikea until 8 p.m. on 1 May , which was not only Labour Day , but also a Sunday .
supermarkets frequently stay open until 10 p.m. on weekdays , and sometimes even round the clock .
the threat of job losses and the shaky state of our economies make it hard to know whether one should support employer or employee groups , the positions of which are inherently opposed .
it is for this reason that I regard Mr Cercas report &quot; and the amendments by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as a sensible compromise , and one aimed at improving people &quot; s overall wellbeing .
on @-@ call time in the workplace should be regarded as working time , and employees should be paid a flat rate for on @-@ call time outside the workplace .
there are certain issues that need to be regulated jointly in the EU , and working time is one of them .
Madam President , the Commissioner has presented us with a legacy that was passed on by his predecessor and it is to his credit that he is showing some enthusiasm in defending it .
after all , it is the consumer who is central in this proposal , and that is important too .
it is important that the consumer knows that claims about health , nutritional values or food cannot be untrue or misleading .
that is what this proposal brings across and that is what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wholehearted supports .
conversely , it is of course the case that those claims that are scientifically proven those - that are true - are useful to consumers .
I do not want to talk about those in terms of advertising , for that , being profitdriven , has a nasty ring to it , but that too is important for consumers .
consumers want to be able to make a choice , and that choice has to be offered to them .
it must be possible , though , to provide scientific proof .
this is something we should not just accept reluctantly , but , I think , should welcome as enhancing the consumers &quot; freedom of choice and promoting innovation , and that too is of importance .
I am aware of there being a grey area around what should be done about those health claims about products that are , in fact , intrinsically unhealthy .
as far as I am concerned , I would say that this falls within the scope of misconception , and Article 7 already provides for safeguards against this ; we are not entirely convinced that we need European nutrient profiles for this .
nutrient profiles can be very useful .
I know that Member States use them .
they may work nationally , but whether they work at European level is something of which the Commission has not yet managed to convince us .
at the moment , I am campaigning in favour of the Constitutional Treaty in the Netherlands .
I do not know if Mrs Corbey is doing the same obviously not but - - if I were to tell people in my country not to worry , for Brussels would soon tell them what they can and cannot eat , then this Treaty would be voted down completely .
that is really not the message we can send out on the basis of arguments we have heard so far .
I therefore want more specific arguments .
the majority of our group will not be voting for the deletion of Article 4 , but we do think that the Commission should present better arguments , and our Amendment 107 contains a request to that effect .
finally , and - as I notice that my time is up - very briefly , since we are for reducing bureaucracy to a minimum , we have opted in favour of the notification procedure which we think offers sufficient guarantees for consumers and entails less Mothering .
on a final note , I agree that obesity must be discussed and tackled , but not in the context of this directive but much more in relation to the food labelling directive which we would have liked to have seen tabled by now .
when you present it to us , Commissioner , then I think it will be much easier to talk about obesity as a problem .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in order to be united politically by means of an economic and social project , and to revive development , Europe needs to have institutions that communicate with its citizens .
the future depends on informed consent .
the vote that took place in France and in the Netherlands does not mean a no &apos; &quot; to Europe but the desire to stop going down the road where decisions are too often made at the top or without taking account of changing circumstances and new economic and social situations .
it is precisely the employment crisis , caused by the social dumping carried out by a number of countries and the lengthy time taken by Europe in tackling the issue , that has created the insecurity and fear that prompted the no vote &apos; &quot; on the Treaty .
it was not so much a case of saying &apos; no &quot; to the Treaty but to the poor information provided , which has also been acknowledged by the Commission in recent weeks .
when it was drawn up , the Treaty was the best compromise possible , but it was not sufficiently well suited to the challenges already in play .
what the people of Europe are demanding is to have clear , applicable rules , which respect the principle of subsidiarity and which are able to provide solutions not only to contingent issues but also to those issues that can be anticipated by analysing the geopolitical and geoeconomic context .
the situation calls for a renewed sense of responsibility on the part of the three Institutions , in order that what is possible is carried out and the decision is made not to address what needs to be put off .
after Bulgaria and Romania have returned to Europe , we believe that enlargement must end , in order that the Union may gather strength through dialogue between the Institutions and the citizens .
at the same time , the links with the European Central Bank need to be addressed in a fresh way , because the Union will never have a future if the political bodies do not have the necessary influence on the drafting of monetary policy .
we call on the Commission and the Council to pronounce on this issue without delay .
the Union has already experienced difficult periods from which it has emerged with the introduction of new initiatives : as a result of the French National Assembly s rejection &quot; in 1954 of the Treaty instituting the European Defence Community , the Conference of Messina was created , followed by the Treaties of Rome .
as a result of the European Community s stagnation &quot; in the 1970s , the Genscher @-@ Colombo project came about , and following the vote at the European Council in Milan in 1985 , under President Craxi , the Single European Act was attained .
we are therefore optimistic that the new Europe can arise out of this very period in which it is clear that the headlong rush of the pro @-@ Europeans and the pessimism of the Eurosceptics provide no guarantees for the future either of individuals or of society as a whole .
Eurorealism is the only path of the present , and it is based on democratic choices and on respect for national identities , in order for a united and shared Europe to be constructed .
Mr President , it is not mere courtesy that compels me to begin by offering my congratulations to the two architects of the achievement - and I use the term advisedly - that has paved the way for the agreement presented to us today on the basis , I must add , of an excellent proposal from the Commission .
my thanks go to those who are seated behind Mr Frattini today .
I wish to thank Mr Cashman , who , in the face of widespread scepticism , in which I initially shared , sought to reach agreement with the Council at first reading .
congratulations , Michael !
but I also wish to extend my congratulations to the Luxembourg Presidency for showing the necessary drive and tenacity to stay on course while encouraging the essential compromises .
it is indeed a marvellous Little Big Land , this Grand Duchy of Luxembourg !
for my part , I had three particular concerns about this dossier .
the first was that , while guaranteeing the rights of the beneficiaries of freedom of movement under Community law , the instrument must also keep open the option of conducting the checks required for the identification at external borders of persons registered for refusal of admission and wanted persons .
the agreement reached on this point , which is reflected in the wording of Article 6 ( 2 ) , corresponds very precisely to the spirit of the amendment I had tabled myself but is an improvement on my proposal , and I am delighted with that .
it seemed to me - and this was my second concern - that , in cases where nationals of non @-@ EU countries were refused entry to the territory of the Union , their rights ought to be clearly defined and made known to the parties concerned , but at the same time security requirements had to be rigorous .
the people of Europe do not want their external borders to be controlled by thugs , but neither do they want to have them controlled by blinded and limbless eunuchs .
the provision that is set out today in Article 11 ( 13 ) is a good provision , and I am delighted about that - just as I am delighted , Mr President , by the confirmation of the exceptional nature of the reintroduction of checks at external borders and by the more prominent role assigned to the Commission and Parliament .
in view of these three grounds for satisfaction , it will give me pleasure to vote in favour of this report , and the entire Group will do likewise .
as I said at first reading , the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) fell short of what was required .
the same objectives and criteria were reaffirmed and indeed more time was given .
what was really needed was the scrapping of the SGP and a clean break from the prevalent economic and monetary policies , in order to create a macroeconomic framework capable of fostering sustained economic growth and employment .
this was not the case .
the excessive deficit procedures continue to be implemented , not least in Portugal , the worst aspect of which is that it serves to justify the austerity measures contained in the stability programmes put forward .
this is true of Portugal , where taxes have gone up and where there has been a concerted attack on public administration , and in particular on public officials .
there is still no desire to learn the lessons that need to be learned .
yet in spite of the cosmetic reform of the SGP , I welcome the rejection of the rapporteur &quot; s maximalist proposals , the aim of which was to strengthen the SGP and to attach greater importance to the debt criterion , offsetting the data provided by national governments against the data provided by the central banks .
in view of the inroads China is making into the EU market , this report is too little , too late .
the future of 170 000 companies and 2.5 million workers in Europe is at stake , as well as a market worth EUR 185 billion .
one need look no further than the US for a good example of how not to take decisions on this matter .
within two years of quotas being lifted in 2002 , China had gained a 65 % market share in the country .
the Chinese problem consists not only in cheap clothing imports , but also in unfair practices such as state subsidies , tax breaks , land distribution and subsidised energy and transport .
if we wish to stop China in its tracks and to keep jobs in Europe , we should convene an extraordinary WTO session to discuss how we can prevent global trade being dominated by a single supplier .
at the same time , we should launch the emergency procedure provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clauses , and set up a new programme to secure funding for regions where the sector provides jobs for workers who would otherwise be unemployed , and ensures that women are not forced into inferior jobs .
we should make funding available for restructuring under the new Financial Perspective , and for new solutions and the implementation of research results in the SME sector under the Seventh Framework Programme .
EU policies should be targeted at modernising industry , as otherwise the Electronic Proposal tool will never be anything but a dead duck .
the governments of heavily industrialised Member States should be granted derogations from the ban on subsidies , and an impact assessment must be carried out for REACH in order to ensure that it does not act as a brake on the competitiveness of European industry .
a consolidated market should be set up under the EU @-@ Mediterranean agreements , and a similar platform should be established in the Baltic region .
- We welcome the scheduling of this debate , as we proposed at the beginning of August .
some 200 000 hectares of forest in Portugal and over 120 000 hectares in Spain have thus far been scorched as a result of the severe drought .
dozens of human lives , including those of firefighters , have been lost ; homes , farms and factories have been destroyed ; protected ecosystems have been lost .
that is without mentioning the heavy emotional cost , for which nothing , nobody , will compensate .
we therefore wish to express our deepest condolences and our solidarity with the bereaved families and with the populations in the affected regions .
we should also like to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the firefighters and the people that have made efforts to combat the fires .
in light of the seriousness of the situation , the Commission must quickly step up its collaboration with the national authorities to support the populations , to help minimise the effects of the fires and the flooding , to support all national support initiatives aimed at restoring the production capacities of the affected regions , thereby creating jobs and providing compensation for the social costs involved in job losses and destruction of livelihoods .
this can be done by activating the Solidarity Fund for the regions and countries affected , if necessary by changing it .
Community administrative procedures must be facilitated , especially those relating to the need to re @-@ programme the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund .
measures must be taken to make these procedures more flexible .
support must be given for the reforestation of the affected areas - taking account of their bio @-@ climatic and ecological characteristics - and for forest fire prevention measures , such as firebreaks , forest tracks , access points , water points and forestry programmes .
payment of certain direct aid to farmers under the common agricultural policy must be brought forward so as to take account of the problem of the fires and the drought on the farming sector .
Article 87 ( 2 ) of the Treaty must also be implemented as a matter of urgency , with the aim of granting appropriate financial aid to all affected sectors .
a further urgently required measure is the implementation of an effective , Community @-@ wide protection system , in order to protect farmers , especially small and medium @-@ sized holdings , against dangers and crises such as those arising from the current drought and fires , or floods . possible measures include a public farmers insurance scheme &quot; financed by Community funds , enabling farmers to receive a minimum wage in the event of public disasters of this nature .
- In this debate on the Middle East situation , we must not overlook the fact that the territory returned to the Palestinian people belongs to them by right and that they have long been fighting for it .
we must also try to clarify the real reasons that led Sharon to dismantle the Gaza settlements , when we know that he was chiefly responsible for devising and implementing the policy of the expansion and consolidation of the Israeli occupation , including the settlements and the wall that seeks to annex further territories on the West Bank .
the first thing to note is that the policy of settling the Gaza Strip was a failure , given the small size of the territory and the massive population density - around 1.3 million people lived in an area measuring just 362 km2 .
this means that the 8 000 Israeli settlers living there ( 0.6 % of the population ) occupied 20 % of the territory , thereby creating unsustainable demographic tension and pressure , leading to devastating consequences .
secondly , Sharon did this , yet continues to maintain the isolation of Gaza , which will remain surrounded - by land , sea and air - by the Israeli army .
this will keep it as an enclave within Israel and land links with the West Bank will remain subject to Israeli control .
. I have been questioned on two substantive points in supplementary questions .
the first supplementary question asked , &apos; have I read the question ? &apos;
I can assure you I have , and it specifically and explicitly states , &apos; does the UK Government strongly support the need for an EU third pillar data protection framework ? &apos;
it goes on to elaborate on that point .
I merely reiterate for clarity that my responsibilities today are to discharge my duties on behalf of the Presidency , rather than to articulate the national position of the United Kingdom Government .
it would be a disservice to this Parliament were I to do anything else .
however , I think anybody who was present in this Chamber this morning and had the opportunity to hear the UK Home Secretary speak , again on behalf of the Presidency , in relation to data protection measures , would have a very clear understanding as to the importance that we attach to the service that can be provided by data protection measures , and the need for a transnational approach to tackling not just issues such as people trafficking and organised crime , but also the pressing threat of international terrorism .
Mr President , the European schools are important to the identity @-@ building process and also to the making of a true European citizenship .
Europe - the EU - is an ongoing building process and its construction has been undertaken in a complex manner .
education plays a very important and fundamental role .
different EU education systems are entitled to spread the ideals and values that Europe has traditionally inspired .
from this , it will help to set up a sense of common European citizenship .
the defence of pluralism and diversity has always been one of the core values that have influenced the European Union .
this is one of the myriad of reasons why a stateless nation &apos;s citizens continually advocate the whole idea of Europe ; we regard Europe as our national environment .
EU enlargement has provided all of us with a new challenge for European schools .
this has to do with a new European Union facing its work .
such a moment will entail greater plurality and a healthy breath of fresh air for European schools .
in a truly pluralist Europe , I consider that real multilingualism cannot be just partially expressed and the real linguistic plurality of our continent has to be uncovered .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , whenever sensible people get so worked up , there has to be something behind it , or else they would not do it .
there are a couple of things of which we can perhaps remind ourselves . up to now , we have not enlarged the European Union ; we have united it .
the Turkey debate is the first real debate on enlargement , for nobody irrespective - of how they are voting - is describing the accession of Poland , the Czech Republic or Hungary as an enlargement of the European idea ; they were a matter of obligation , for it was right and proper to welcome these countries after the collapse of Communism .
what we are now dealing with really is a new dimension .
this is about enlargement .
no matter which way we decide , this is a new dimension .
just shut up , will you ?
we do indeed have a new dimension to deal with , and the question with which it presents us is this : is it , post @-@ 9 / 11 , important in terms of Europe s interests &quot; to give Turkey the chance of accession ?
that question can be answered in different ways , but it must be answered by reference to the interests of the European Union , the interests of the people of Europe , rather than on the basis of emotional , cultural , or racist resentments .
that is not acceptable and we do not want it !
if you are not , if you do not think I mean you , then I do not .
in that case , I mean Mr de Villiers .
stop thinking that everything refers to you !
you are not the centre of the universe !
at present , the arguments used in Europe against Turkey rely on feelings , on racist resentments directed against Islam .
not all those who are against Turkey use these arguments , but they ride the wave of these sentiments .
it follows that all those in the no camp &apos; &quot; must ask themselves what their arguments unleash , and it is for that reason that I think it right to argue that Europe needs to change first , that Europe has to do its homework , and that Europe needs a constitution ; these are things with which nobody disagrees .
Europe cannot enlarge itself the way it is now .
as to whether Europe can , subject to the conditions in the Treaty of Nice , make itself more united by including Croatia , I too have my doubts .
that is a legitimate debate .
the other debate , though - the debate about whether Europe can absorb a country whose population is predominantly Muslim - is nonsensical .
today , in Europe , there are more Muslims than there are Belgians .
they are already included among us .
the question of how European Islam is will arise with Turkey or without it , so let us stop discussing it .
Islam is the third @-@ largest religion in Europe ; whether I , as an atheist , find that to my liking is another matter .
it is for that reason that the only question to be asked at the end of this debate is what Turkey will be like in ten years time . &quot; will it be a democratic state , a secular state ?
is Islam European ? will this same Turkey be prepared to join with us Europeans in contending for the values that we enshrine in a constitution ?
if the answer to those questions is in the affirmative , then I will bid it welcome ; if not , then we will have to think up something else .
- I was a Member of Parliament s delegation &quot; at the Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliament , organised by the Inter @-@ Parliamentary Union in New York on 7 , 8 and 9 September .
in my address to the 145 delegations in attendance , I reaffirmed Parliament &quot; s recent positions as regards the reform of the United Nations and the commitment towards the Millennium Development Goals .
my message was given greater resonance by the fact that previously all European Parliament resolutions on issues such as this were disclosed to the national and regional political delegations .
with specific regard to the reform of the United Nations , I told the delegates that Parliament stands four @-@ square behind the positions adopted by the UN Secretary @-@ General , such as his view that world security is intrinsically linked to economic and social development , respect for human rights and environmental protection .
I also mentioned the need to press ahead with changes to the composition of the Security Council ; I believe that the EU should eventually have a permanent seat , and that new seats should be created at the earliest opportunity enabling new countries and emerging regions to be represented .
my last point on the United Nations General Assembly was that not only should there be reform of working methods but also that there should ultimately be a proper United Nations parliamentary assembly .
my plan was to contribute to the debate with this brief overview , which will also act as the report on the mission that I am required to make to Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , right from the very start of this parliamentary term some of us have been paying particular attention to the subject of the urban dimension , and none more so than Mr Beaupuy .
he was already doing so before the creation of the European Parliament s Urban Housing Intergroup , &quot; of which he himself is Chairman and I a member , and which is working very well .
I thank the Commissioner for supporting in so timely a fashion the approach we take to our work , and for encouraging it .
she demonstrated her support yet again just now in her speech to this House .
Parliament , it is clear , is today requested to make an additional commitment - which I think I can guarantee , and I speak for Mr Beaupuy too - to involve itself more fully , with a view to preventing any disastrous backtracking by the Council .
backtracking would only reduce the role of cities , a role which , in my opinion , is not only an essential part of cohesion policy , but also represents one of its central pillars .
cities are , in fact , the key players in regional policy .
as well as being centres for the most complex issues , such as social exclusion and pollution , they are centres in which the futures of their entire surrounding areas are moulded , a fact I have also tried to assert in my role as shadow rapporteur on the European Regional Development Fund regulation .
the driving force of a programme which sensibly invests and manages funds earmarked for cities can , and must , give a similar economic and socio @-@ cultural boost to suburbs and surrounding rural areas , especially in the light of the recent enlargement of the European Union .
that is why I believe that today we need to engage even more with this subject , based on the experience that this Parliament has already acquired .
I welcome the rapporteur s work &quot; on this issue .
I feel it is a balanced report , and has clarified and improved upon some key points that had been poorly explained in the version submitted by the Commission .
the measures put forward seek to protect the overall interests of the fisheries sector .
the report was based on the opinions of administrative fisheries bodies in the new Member States , of the processing sectors and of other fishing industry representatives .
consultancy of this nature is a key factor in ensuring that the measures to be implemented are properly assessed .
the proposals adopted today are intended to adapt the equipment used in other marine environments to the conditions in the Baltic , which has particular characteristics that require specific measures .
although my opinion is a favourable one , I shall be keeping a close eye on the issue of the effects of driftnets and other entangling equipment on sea mammals .
we should proceed in accordance with the findings of studies carried out up to 2008 , with one option being to consider withdrawing this method of fishing .
. Madam President , I would like to comment on a few points which have arisen from the debate .
one such point is the question of human rights abusers who have been elected to parliament , because this is something that concerns us all .
unfortunately , Afghanistan has not embarked with any ease on a process to come to terms with its past , and I hope it will take its time .
in such circumstances , it is deeply regrettable , but probably inevitable , that this first post @-@ conflict election will result in some questionable individuals being elected to parliament .
politically , the key question is how much influence these individuals will have in parliament , and I think it is too early to judge , since the voting system , as many have mentioned , myself included , is very complicated .
there are no clear party blocks .
Parliament will certainly be very fragmented .
I would also like to highlight some positive aspects about some of the people who were elected .
there were courageous people with a record of standing up for justice and human rights in Afghanistan who also managed to get elected , including , as many of you mentioned , quite a significant number of women .
I met some of the women candidates and , admittedly , I was really surprised and I very much appreciated their courage .
when I met them , they said that they had been out working with many women , and I am sure they all said &apos; we will get elected . &quot;
ultimately , that has proved to be the case .
that is a very positive development .
furthermore , it is also positive to note that , although a few Taliban were elected , many prominent Taliban were not successful in the elections .
the former foreign minister , the former deputy interior minister and the former deputy justice minister were all defeated .
I am sure that the voters knew whom they should not vote for .
I would also like to say a few words about drugs .
we realise that the drug question is still a very important one .
we have also discussed it with President Karzai and are working with the UK Presidency to see what we can do in the future to tackle this problem even more robustly on two fronts - the first of which is alternative plantations , the second being justice and law - which are to be reinforced .
finally , education is one of the key questions .
I would like to put my finger on that issue for future programmes , not only because it applies to the whole of society , but specifically because , over many decades , women did not have any opportunities and we have to compensate for that in some way .
in 2004 alone , we built 50 schools and childcare institutions .
we also have a specific project for street children .
I visited this project and , again , I must say that I saw how much courage and enthusiasm there is among the young children , the beautiful girls and really handsome boys who have a future .
they want to get off the streets where they are normally selling vegetables and other small things .
I agree that education and healthcare will be the key issues , and we will certainly continue to put our emphasis on those issues .
Mr President , the rapporteur , Mrs Fourtou , and her fellow members of the Committee on Petitions have worked very hard on this report , an initiative from this House in response to thousands of petitions received by the committee .
I would like to thank all those involved for their work and valuable contributions to this difficult and delicate debate .
this is indeed of concern to many EU citizens , as shown by the number of petitions received .
two fact @-@ finding missions were sent to Valencia , which gave the committee members an opportunity to meet with representatives of all those concerned and to have a first @-@ hand experience of the situation on the ground .
you know better than anyone else the issues at stake .
Mrs Fourtou s report &quot; touches upon a number of important topics which have attracted the political attention of this House .
the Commission , within the limits of its competences , has looked into this matter mainly from an internal market perspective .
in concrete terms we have analysed the public procurement dimension of the Spanish law .
I shall concentrate on that .
the Commission takes the view that the approval of integrated action programmes under the Valencia Land Planning Law involves the award of public work and service contracts .
early in this process the Commission considered that the Valencia Land Planning Law raised questions with respect to EU public procurement legislation .
contracts were awarded without transparency or publication of notices in the EU Official Journal .
there were no objective selection or award criteria , no appropriate price clauses , and no equality of opportunity for all those interested in the business opportunity .
the Commission therefore decided to launch infringement proceedings against Spain on this issue and sent a letter of formal notice on 21 March 2005 .
since then , we have been working together with the relevant authorities to correct the defects that were detected with the application of the existing law .
however , the draft new law that was submitted to my services does not correct all problems identified .
in addition , the practical situation has not changed .
public authorities continue to award public contracts without following appropriate tendering procedures .
in view of this lack of progress , in a few days I plan to send a letter to the competent authorities in Spain asking them to take appropriate measures to remedy the situation .
reconciling planning requirements and procurement laws can be highly complex .
however , this must not be an excuse for not applying the EU procurement rules .
these rules bring benefits for public authorities , by increasing competition for public contracts and lowering the price of works , supplies and services .
therefore , you can count on my commitment to ensure that EU public procurement rules are respected , both in the letter and the practice , of whatever legislation is approved in the future .
Mrs Fourtou s report &quot; also raised a number of other issues of concern , but as they fall outside the scope of Community competence , the Commission is not in a position to address them .
we regret the fact that our proposal in support of increasing the global financial envelope for fisheries was rejected .
this rejection is typical of the inconsistency of both Parliament and the rapporteur ; both acknowledge that the budget falls short of what is required if we are to address the economic and social crisis facing the sector , and yet despite the fact that it is one of the key issues in the report before us , it is not being increased .
we are very pleased , on the other hand , that our proposal aimed at funding measures to promote or set up small @-@ scale coastal fishing representative associations , and to ensure their involvement in the decision @-@ making process of the common fisheries policy was adopted .
this proposal was in line with the outcome of the public hearing on this section of the fleet held by Parliament s Committee &quot; on Fisheries .
I should like to point out that there are aspects of the current regulation on which we have reservations , due to their ramifications for the sovereignty of Member States .
examples of this include the role of the Community Fisheries Control Agency , and the rapporteur s proposal &quot; to set up a framework agreement as regards the fisheries agreements with third countries .
we therefore opted to abstain .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for a change , I should like to speak in favour of the current process of reforming the common organisation of the market in sugar , albeit with a very specific eye on sugar in the outermost regions .
while the EU is committed to cutting back sugar production to bring it into line with world trade rules , the French overseas departments are on a diametrically opposite course , which consists of further increasing production in order to ensure that sustainable jobs are maintained and created , and that the fragile balance of both farming and industrial operations is preserved .
as regards the Commission s proposals , &quot; it can be said that Réunion , Guadeloupe and Martinique are pioneers in adapting their sugar cane sector .
this is firstly because their level of production have remained well below authorised quotas , and they are thus not part of Community overproduction , and secondly because , in the past thirty years , factories have gradually merged .
accordingly , it is no longer possible to envisage either stopping or cutting back activities without upsetting the whole balance of the sector .
sugar cane has become a valuable commodity , capable of producing not only sugar but also energy , using bagasse or indeed natural manure .
in the overseas departments , multifunctionality in agriculture is not merely some theoretical project , it is a reality .
moreover , it is precisely because they were pioneers that the overseas departments cannot go any further .
whereas the Commission and the Council have refused any further financial concessions to the departments , France has been authorised to implement provisions paving the way for state aid to be granted , in addition to the Community funds , via the political agreement in the Council ahead of the WTO summit in Hong Kong .
there could be compensation for price cuts , with some leeway for increased production , which would return some sense of stability and visibility to a sector that has endured two years of uncertainty .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Fruteau , on his efforts and would formally ask you , Commissioner , to retain the provisions in the Council s compromise &quot; on sugar in the overseas departments in order to ensure the sector &quot; s future .
Mr President , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy applauds the Commission s initiative &quot; to deregulate and liberalise package sizes .
my committee considers that a free market works in the best interests of the consumer .
we were persuaded to accept the Commission s proposal &quot; to make exceptions for alcoholic beverages , soluble coffee , white sugar - we added brown sugar for consistency and - for aerosols .
in the interests of consistency , we also proposed a regulated size for spirits bottles of 750 cl , which was the widely accepted size of wine bottles .
it verges on the misleading to have 750 cl the standard bottle for wine and 700 cl the standard bottle for spirits .
therefore , we regret that this proposal was rejected by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
we appreciate that the Committee on the Internal Market and its very conscientious rapporteur , my good friend Mr Toubon , have considered these matters very thoroughly .
however , we in the Committee on Industry are disappointed to see proposals from that committee to introduce fixed , harmonised , mandatory sizes on a whole range of staple products which have not previously been so harmonised .
we have labelling requirements .
we prohibit misleading advertising .
EU legislation requires unit pricing so that the price for a standard amount must be displayed , and this helps consumers to compare prices fairly .
the ability to decide freely on package sizes is in the interests of the smaller business , the new entrant , the innovative enterprise and , therefore , also in the interests of the consumer .
there is nothing to stop marketing of traditional sizes ; there is nothing to stop the use of traditional measures such as pints and pounds .
the Commission proposal did not even mention milk .
nothing needed to change from the status quo .
the Committee on Industry suggests that Parliament support the Commission s praiseworthy attempt &quot; to reduce unnecessary regulation and vote against the Committee on the Internal Market s proposed extension &quot; of mandatory sizes to all these extra products .
- Besides bad news from Minsk , there is also good news from Vilnius .
today , the Lithuanian Government registered the European Humanities University , which was recently exiled from Minsk and has renewed its activities in Vilnius .
this is the result of huge efforts by some Members of the European Parliament , together with representatives of the European Commission and Lithuanian diplomats .
the students of this university doubtless give real hope for the revival of Belarus .
at the same time we have received some bad news from Minsk .
the dictatorship is intensifying its repression of democratic civil youth organisations opposed to the regime .
the work of the Belarusian Union of Youth and Children &apos;s Public associations RADA &apos; &quot; has been banned by a decision of the regime .
this youth organisation had already won international recognition and was developing relations between young people in Belarus and many European youth organisations .
I would , therefore , like to appeal to all of my colleagues and trust that they will endorse the demand for an end to the repression directed against the youth of Belarus and their organisations .
Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for the thought that has gone into the report and for its presentation .
the search for environmentally friendly methods of fishing is as long as the history of fishing itself .
even in ancient times legal and technical measures were put in place in order to limit catches and avoid depleting the stocks and damaging the biomass and consequently the environment .
only in the particular circumstances of the early 19th century were all restrictions on fishing lifted .
at the end of the century things returned to normal , in other words , protective restrictions were reintroduced .
it seems that more complex protective measures based on scientific research were developed mid @-@ way through the 20th century .
these favoured so @-@ called optimal fishing that involved regulating the age of the first catch .
there followed provisions on the permitted size of fish caught and the principles of selective fishing gear .
on the other hand , they simply restricted the limits , fishing effort and fishing potential .
as to specific issues in the document before us , I believe it is worth mentioning the new approach to protective principles .
in contrast to the protective measures applied to date , which mainly related to selective fishing , it is now proposed to protect the hitherto unwanted elements of the catch .
I think this is eminently rational and indeed noble . it would seem to be a case of political correctness as applied to fish .
will this really be beneficial to the environment , though ?
experience has shown that selective fishing always weakens the biological strength of desirable species in the ecosystem .
the less useful species can take over the niche vacated by the more desirable ones .
it is therefore vital to recommend ongoing monitoring of the population of both groups and the relationship between them .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I feel that the key points have already been mentioned , but I should like to offer you a synopsis of my analysis of this debate , which , I note , is broadly supportive of the conclusions of the European Council .
an honest assessment would certainly reveal that these results have overall been welcomed .
it is obvious that not all of the honourable Members are entirely satisfied , because there are naturally differences of opinion .
there can be no denying , however , that we have seen results in the energy sector , in SMEs , in research , in the employment objectives and overall in the new system of governance of the Lisbon Strategy .
consensus has also been achieved at European Council level as regards the services directive .
as regards energy , I wish to underline that our work has certainly not finished at the European Council and that the results of yesterday &apos;s Commission meeting will show you that the Commission is determined to ensure that all of the principles of Community law are upheld : for example , compliance with the principles of the internal market and with competition rules .
this is a vital prerequisite if we want to retain credibility , both within and outside the EU .
as regards SMEs , a particularly important step was the encouragement by the Austrian Presidency and the Commission to reduce the red tape that hampers so many potentially job @-@ creating initiatives by companies .
as for research , for the first time all Member States were able to accept workable research and innovation objectives , and this is extremely important .
equally important was the broad support for the idea of the European Institute of Technology and for the Commission now having a mandate to put forward a proposal .
the fact that employment objectives were set is also very positive .
I should like to underline one new aspect that arose at this European Council to which Chancellor Schüssel did not allude , but which I feel is worthy of mention .
to some extent we already work in team presidencies .
Chancellor Schüssel , as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , has taken every opportunity to introduce the debate to the Commission , and to the forthcoming Finnish , German , Portuguese and Slovene Presidencies .
I believe this is important in terms of ensuring the continuity and sustainability of the Commission s efforts . &quot;
the Commission is also able to provide such continuity and consistency over time because , however good the Council presidencies may be , they change every six months .
there needs to be constant effort , which can only happen if the Commission takes the lion s share &quot; of the initiative and if Parliament provides constant support .
these points were positive .
similarly welcome were the confirmation of the agreement in principle on the services directive , and the news we received last night , or I should say early this morning , on the financial perspective .
I am totally convinced that if we achieve practical results , if we manage to resolve problems on a regular basis , we can take this Europe of projects forward , regain the confidence of our citizens and find a better environment for resolving some of the institutional issues that need to be resolved .
I therefore feel that we can look forward more positively to the June European Council , which of course will not be able to resolve the constitutional question , but which will certainly be able to point the way forward towards defining Europe &quot; s future .
the Commission is working actively with the Council to this end and we hope to be able to make a worthwhile contribution .
with this team spirit , this spirit of partnership , Europe can and must move ahead .
Mr President , funding is threatening the very existence of Palestinian institutions and there is a very real risk that they will collapse .
teachers and doctors have not been paid for months and it is the Palestinian people , civilians , who are paying the price of the EU s position , &quot; which represents a collective punishment against the Palestinian people for their democratic choices .
not only that , but it is also utterly counter @-@ productive .
to suspend funding is to undermine the very political and judicial reforms which the EU has been supporting ; to suspend funding is to drive people into the arms of extremists and into the arms of Iran in particular , with risks of much greater fundamentalist influence .
you talk about principles , but it is vital that the EU is consistent .
you cannot make demands of Hamas that you do not make of Israel .
yes , mutual recognition and an end to violence on both sides are urgently needed , but it has to be on both sides .
Israel has to recognise Palestine and to stop its state violence too .
so my question to the Council is this : in the coming days the Israeli Government will be formed .
will the Council ask the new Israeli Government if it is committed to the roadmap and to the past agreement as presented by the Quartet , and will it ask if the Israeli Government is committed to a cessation of violence against the Palestinians , just as we ask Hamas to do all in its power to end violence against Israel ?
every nation is proud of its language and wishes to preserve and use it in a united Europe too .
the cultural image of Europe is enriched by linguistic diversity .
and by learning foreign languages we also become acquainted with a nation s culture , &quot; its history and its land and this also contributes to greater mutual respect .
learning foreign languages is a real struggle for adults but for children it is more often than not a game .
it is therefore right and proper that we should introduce into schools the teaching of two foreign languages even in the earliest stages of education .
knowing other languages also makes it easier for us to establish friendly ties with other peoples , and this is especially important for the peoples of neighbouring countries , since it is with our neighbours that we usually have most in common and also the largest number of problems .
for this reason it is sometimes beyond comprehension that certain politicians should build their political power on the limiting of the rights of minorities to use their mother tongue , as is happening to the Slovenian minority in Austrian Carinthia and the minority in Italy .
Austria and Slovenia cooperate closely in various fields , and I am certain therefore that Austria s democratic public &quot; does not approve of Mr Haider s anti @-@ Slovenian actions . &quot;
the Austrian Presidency of the European Union has been exemplary .
I would therefore call once again upon the government and democratic people of Austria to abide by the Austrian State Treaty , which lays down the rights of minorities .
I would also call upon the Italian Government to begin to implement the law protecting the Slovenian minority .
European Union institutions should also play a more important role where there are infringements of minority rights , and should issue serious warnings to countries that guarantee minority rights on paper , but in practice violate their own laws and also the rules of the European Union .
we voted against because multilingualism is not considered in all of its practical applications .
steps are being taken that may lead to the creation of a directory to select the languages used .
it is appalling that the proposals to broaden the range of languages , including those of immigrants , were rejected .
to quote the Commission : &apos; the EU institutions should try to strike a balance between the costs and benefits of being multilingual . &quot;
this sentence follows a series of repeated examples of discrimination relating to the use , translation and interpretation of the official languages of the EU , and to the dismissal of dozens of teachers who worked in the Commission s services . &quot;
this serves to increase our concerns as regards the need to promote multilingualism as a cultural value of the EU .
we therefore advocate an interinstitutional agreement relating to a written legal framework for the EU s language arrangements . &quot;
an agreement of this nature should respect the diversity of cultures and languages , given that language is the most direct expression of culture .
it should also guarantee equal treatment of all official languages , thereby putting an end to the proposed distinction between &apos; official languages &quot; and &apos; working languages , &quot; which has served to discriminate against certain languages like Portuguese .
I wish to join in thanking the rapporteurs , Mrs Scheele and Mrs Poli Bortone , the shadow rapporteurs , the Commission and the Council for the work they have done on ensuring that , tomorrow , we have an agreement on which to adopt a position and that will make it much simpler for consumers to make healthier choices , because they have access to more accurate and more comprehensive information .
many of us have undoubtedly bought breakfast cereal , bread or yoghurt that , when we were in the shop , we understood to be extremely healthy .
when we have come home , we have discovered that the yoghurt may not have contained any fat but , instead , contained a large quantity of sugar .
it is not by chance that many of us have been placed in this position .
companies know that we wish to make healthy choices and therefore do everything to make food appear beneficial , even if it is sometimes the very opposite of that .
a familiar device is for the manufacturer to select an individual ingredient perceived by consumers to be beneficial and then to emphasise this using large thick letters , at the same time as using microscopic lettering to state , for example , the sugar and fat content .
the agreement on which we shall vote tomorrow may put an end to these and many other types of misleading advertisement .
statements about health benefits need to be substantiated scientifically and not be made about products that , considered as a whole , are not good for people s health . &quot;
if , in future , companies wish to highlight the presence in an item of food of a particular ingredient that people perceive as beneficial , then that item of food should not , in principle , have an unduly high sugar , fat , salt or alcohol content .
obviously , there is still a lot of work to be done on this regulation , and we shall monitor future work carefully and , in particular , the preparation of nutrient profiles .
I and many others in my group are extremely proud of this agreement , but we are also prepared , if need be , to come back with further requirements designed to make it more stringent .
Mr President , like my colleague , Mrs Sommer , I can only express my deep dissatisfaction faced with the common position that has been submitted to us for second reading .
we have here a typical example of a missed opportunity , particularly on the part of the Commission , to support the reasonable position adopted by Parliament at first reading , and this at a time when Mr Barroso constantly regales us with arguments in favour of more subsidiarity , less bureaucracy , and I could go on .
seeking to impose nutrient profiles on consumers , without any scientific evidence , is as unacceptable as it is rash .
Mr Schnellhardt illustrated this point well .
as chairman of this Parliament &apos;s wine intergroup &apos; , &quot; I have a duty to emphasise the disproportionate nature of the total ban on any claim appearing on alcoholic beverages of more than 1.2 % volume .
not only is wine the subject of specific Community regulations , but very credible scientific evidence exists to show that wine , when consumed in moderation , meaning two or three glasses per day for example , is good for a person s health . &quot;
it is , among other things , effective in preventing cardiovascular diseases , cancer and dementia , a point that the Commissioner and his services magisterially overlook .
the compromise worked on by Mrs Sommer , whom I thank , is merely the lesser evil .
I can only lament the little understanding shown by the Council and the Commission regarding this matter , as well as the consequences of their obstinacy , particularly for employment .
in order to give the Council and the Commission one last chance to reconsider some incomprehensible positions that could compromise the conciliation procedure and the objectives set by the Lisbon Strategy , we , together with Mrs Klass , have tabled an amendment that excludes wine and beer from the scope of Article 4 ( 3 ) , so as not to harm sectors that have been part of our cultural and culinary heritage for thousands of years .
if politics is the art of the possible , the search for an agreement on the EU s financial framework &quot; for 2007 @-@ 2013 has proved to be the art of the minimum possible , which is not a cause for satisfaction .
the EU has over the last few years undergone a major enlargement process to include new countries and political integration .
this needs to be matched by increased funding .
for the prosperity and security project that the EU represents for its citizens to be a reality , it requires a financial framework to match that ambition and its new size .
furthermore , the notion of solidarity , which has always been an integral part of the make @-@ up of the EU &apos;s financial institutions , is justified on the grounds that it is fair and that it seeks to promote a balanced and effective internal market .
in light of these considerations , and in particular the impossibility of going beyond the limited budgetary outcome , my vote in favour is coloured by this regret .
it also comes , however , with the hope that the entire budgetary structure will in due course be rethought with a view to promoting a more development @-@ friendly economy , via the review of the expenditure heading .
Mr President , I believe Mr Capoulas Santos report &quot; is excellent and much needed by farmers .
however , I would like to highlight the rather perfunctory treatment of the damages caused by frost , which is also a form of natural disaster .
I understand that natural disasters such as fires and droughts are issues somewhat closer to the rapporteur s heart &quot; because he lives in the Mediterranean region .
in Central and Northern European countries , frost causes very serious financial losses in the agricultural sector , especially in orchards and in the field of soft fruit production .
when working on this draft , we should create a systemic solution that could apply to all regions of the European Union and all types of natural disasters .
that is why the elements that have so far been omitted should be incorporated into the report in order to make it complete .
another issue that was greatly emphasised in the report was the question of migration from rural areas and farmers abandoning their farms .
this is partly caused by the lack of viability and the high cost of forest management .
serious losses in the forestry sector are caused by inappropriate forest management , monocultures across large woodland areas as well as the planting of inappropriate species of trees .
I would just like to point out that , during discussions concerning this forestry strategy in Parliament two months ago , Members failed to mention the huge areas of forest where forest management is carried out in an exemplary fashion .
I am referring here to state @-@ owned forests , including those in Poland , where fires and hurricanes also cause significant damage .
Mr President , since mutual trust between the United States and the European Union has come under pressure in recent years , I should like to single out two things that need to be resolved in order for that trust to be rebuilt .
we should not resign ourselves to the visa requirements which the United States imposes on some EU citizens .
Commission President Barroso was right to urge the United States to lift the visa requirements for citizens from the ten new Member States .
it is unfair , on principle , to use double standards such as these for EU citizens .
in the coming weeks , the temporary committee of inquiry into alleged CIA camps will be discussing its draft interim report .
there are indications that irregularities have occurred in the treatment of suspects , but so far , there is no hard evidence of this .
this temporary committee will continue its activities in order to deliver convincing evidence , if possible .
in that light , Parliament will , in the run @-@ up to the Summit , need to insist on substantial cooperation .
I should like to ask your support for paragraph 11 from the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , which has been tabled as Amendment 34 .
globalisation offers a number of opportunities , especially for reducing poverty .
trade and technical cooperation both help strengthen poor countries economies . &quot;
at the same time , there are risks and problems .
the poorest countries are often in no position to participate in economic cooperation because of a lack of capacity and so forth and are in danger of getting left even further behind .
what is more , environmental legislation at international level , as well as in many poor countries , leaves a lot to be desired , leading to a rapid increase in waste products , as well as in over @-@ exploitation and in the unsustainable use of a variety of natural resources such as forests and fish , and all these developments are intensified through swiftly growing trade .
these problems must be got to grips with as soon as possible if the advantages of globalisation are not to be turned into disadvantages .
- New measures to strike at the grassroots struggle at national and European level are proposed in the report on the strengthening of cross @-@ border police cooperation at international EU events .
it insultingly provides for a &apos; calendar of international events &apos; to be held every year in order to programme and organise cooperation between the repressive mechanisms of the ΕU used to combat grassroots movements .
thus preventive repression is being promoted within the framework of the more general imperialist doctrine of preventive war at home and abroad , in the objective of &apos; protecting &apos; summits and all kinds of international meetings of imperialist organisations from the enemy the people .
the people of Europe have first @-@ hand knowledge of the murderous action of the EU &apos;s repressive mechanisms in Gothenburg , in Genoa and in other countries .
every day they have to deal with restrictions on their most fundamental rights and freedoms .
the Greek Communist Party voted against the report .
it will help to develop a movement of resistance from the working @-@ class and grassroots movement at national and European level to defend grassroots freedoms .
defiance , disobedience and the abolition in practice of the decisions of the ΕU and governments abolishing vested democratic rights are the right and obligation of the peoples .
Madam President , I apologise for being late .
I flew out from Heathrow this morning .
I have lost my luggage , so I have no clothes or make @-@ up and look pale and ugly , but I hope that is alright !
in London you have to take everything out of your bag .
Madam President , thank you for your contributions , and many thanks too on behalf of the Commissioner .
we have already had a debate on this report and very much agree with the Commission s proposal . &quot;
I have to say that my country , Denmark , does not support the Commission s proposal . &quot;
I , for my part , do , however , even though I have amended it .
I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for its considerable support .
I should also like to thank you for your sound amendments and thank the large majority that has supported me .
I should like to discuss a number of points that I think it is important to emphasise before we vote tomorrow .
firstly , I should like to stress why this is a constructive proposal .
it is constructive because it takes account of the environment .
as is well known , the proposal is about abolishing registration taxes on passenger cars and instead introducing a new system involving an annual tax based on the car &quot; s emissions of pollutants .
in the committee , we have gone a step further than in the Commission s original proposal , &quot; since the Commission only wanted an annual tax based on CO2 emissions .
however , CO2 is not , of course , the only source of pollution .
in my report I therefore recommend that the tax be based on all pollutants and particles detrimental to air quality .
it is important to send a signal to the car industry to the effect that tax on cars depends on the level of pollution they cause .
hopefully , the proposal will therefore create an incentive for the car industry to produce cars that consume less petrol and cause less pollution .
the second important consideration - to which the Commissioner too attaches a lot of importance - is freedom of movement .
at present there are 25 different tax systems with 25 different ways of calculating car taxes .
many systems are based on outmoded rules , and registration taxes can be an obstacle to freedom of movement .
there is a risk of double taxation , and car owners often have to pay proportionately much more on their used cars when they transport them from one Member State to another .
that is simply unacceptable .
it is also important from the committee s point &quot; of view to emphasise that we want the proposal to be budget @-@ neutral .
it is very important that this change should not involve expenditure disadvantageous to the Member States - either in a transitional period or subsequently .
allow me to state , moreover , that the EU is not introducing a tax policy by means of this proposal .
it is entirely up to the Member States themselves to decide how high the tax is to be and of what it is to be composed .
I would therefore also call on the Council to vote in favour of this proposal , even though I know that it is on a sticky wicket in , for example , my own country and the United Kingdom .
consideration could of course be given to using the option offered by the Treaty of Nice of enhanced cooperation and allowing some Member States to go further than others .
finally , there is a fourth important consideration , namely that there should be a long transitional period .
it is important for the whole market , the industry , car owners and systems generally to be able to get themselves organised , and I therefore consider that a ten @-@ year period is necessary for countries to be able to change their systems without incurring anything other than necessary costs .
this will also ensure renewal of the stock of cars on the road .
these are , then , the four relevant points : a long transitional period , budget neutrality , freedom of movement and consideration for the environment .
finally , I just want to comment on the proposals from Mr Langen on behalf of the Group of the European People s Party &quot; ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
I support these proposals , since I agree that there must be proportionality between the tax on cars and those cars emissions &quot; of pollutants .
I also of course agree that we must protect veteran cars , and I therefore have nothing against veteran cars being exempt from the proposal .
I do not myself own a veteran car , but I have every sympathy for owners of such vehicles .
I cannot recommend the amendments by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , since they are not in keeping with the overall thrust of the report , apart from anything else because an earlier entry into force would be unrealistic .
that was what I had to say .
Mr President , and not Madam President - I can see there has been a change of President - once again , excuse me for being so late .
I hope that you will bear with me , and I look forward to a constructive vote tomorrow .
- Mr President , Commissioner , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , as you have said , the fact that we have succeeded in obtaining a ceasefire is already an important result in a war that , in just a few weeks , has caused a great many deaths , destroyed infrastructure and the environment , and was threatening to engulf the whole region .
this initial result is the outcome of a European initiative in close cooperation with the United Nations .
allow me to mention the active role played by my own country , Italy , and also by the Finnish Presidency and by France , which is to lead UNIFIL during this phase .
the challenge , however , remains much more arduous and requires the whole of Europe to make not just a military effort , but a political and diplomatic one .
for the first time , Europe could demonstrate a united political will and the determination to play a constructive role in the Mediterranean and Middle East by equipping itself with the appropriate tools .
it is a question of supporting Lebanon in the difficult process of independence and sovereignty , helping it to continue along the democratic path that raised so much hope during the Beirut spring &apos; . &quot;
the Lebanese army has to regain control of the whole country , including the south , and it has to exercise a monopoly on military strength to the exclusion of Hizbollah , which in recent times has become a parallel power .
such an outcome requires everyone to take responsibility , starting with Syria , which has a role in the region , while Israel must be persuaded to abandon the idea of the indiscriminate use of force , because that is not a path that can guarantee its security .
it has already been said that the Palestinian issue lies at the heart of the Middle East situation .
Europe &quot; s task is to fully accept the responsibility that all the parties in the conflict now attribute to it : to support the Palestinians difficult internal process &quot; of forming a new government that will enable them to come out of isolation and win back the resources that Israel must return to them .
it could be the beginning of a new climate of relations between the two sides , but first of all the spiral of violence needs to stop .
the years of experience that we have acquired show that the two sides cannot do it alone : the international community s presence &quot; is essential , and so we could deploy the peacekeeping troops that are in Lebanon today to Gaza and the West Bank tomorrow .
it could be a first step towards restoring that agreement , in the run @-@ up to an international conference that may lead to a stable , lasting solution for the entire area , as the President @-@ in @-@ Office mentioned .
- Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by expressing my appreciation and congratulations to Mrs Krehl for this , an important component of cohesion policy for the coming years .
after all , it is the task of the strategic guidelines to supplement the Regulation governing the Structural Funds and to support the national and regional authorities in programme planning .
consequently , these guidelines contain the political priorities for the investments to be made .
the new strategic guidelines rightly focus more than before on growth and jobs , with the emphasis on knowledge and information society , entrepreneurship and employment .
in other words , the priority here is the Lisbon Strategy , but I should like to emphasise that this is pursued never as an end in itself , but rather within - the framework of cohesion policy always - with a view to achieving the objective of strengthening economic cohesion and of pan @-@ European competitiveness .
in so doing , these guidelines must also take account of the promotion of investment in individual businesses by means of subsidies designed especially for SMEs .
concern must still be expressed about the considerable administrative burden in the field of European structural policy , which , unfortunately , is not significantly reduced by the requirements set out in these guidelines .
I should also like to emphasise that we must not only make intelligent , efficient , targeted use of the scant resources at our disposal , but also attach great importance to private cofinancing at project level .
unfortunately , public private partnerships - are still used much too rarely in connection with the Structural Funds , particularly because of a large number of unresolved legal issues .
we must now do our utmost , as quickly as possible , to enable countries to submit their operational programmes soon , and particularly to afford them a smooth transition to the new aid period .
Mr President , I too should like to sing the praises of Mr Krehl &apos;s report and the results that have now been incorporated in the directive , including those achieved in the past two and a half years by Mrs Hübner in the debate at European level .
I am in favour of earmarking ; we should be able to admit to this in this Chamber , and I am the first to do so .
this also means , though , that we can eliminate the noncommittal dimension and fragmentation to the left and right in policy .
in doing so , we can update the cohesion policy to include it in a new agenda : that of Lisbon .
the emphasis is shifting from less concrete and less asphalt to training our people in knowledge society .
we will , in the next 20 years , need to focus on cut @-@ throat competition at world level .
Central will then be the role of Parliament in this new era , with an interim review in 2009 @-@ 2010 .
what we can then look forward to is agriculture being weighed up against cohesion policy and against Europe s external role &quot; in the world .
the focus will then be even more on the policy &quot; s added value .
it is because of that role that in the committee , I pledged my support to the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance that looks to enhance Parliament s role &quot; during reassessment .
I am also asking the Commissioner and the European Commission whether we will have sufficient information at our disposal in order to be able to hold a proper debate on the financial reprioritisation .
I am asking you for information about what the nation states are now doing .
I sense a reluctance among our Member States to report adequately , and I regard that as a real disgrace .
they are given the instruments and should respond accordingly .
it is true that the new synthesis for the new era and the new financial proportions will require a significantly reassessed policy , as well as a permanent role for the regions and the towns in the cohesion policy .
. - I abstained from voting on this report .
the report presented in plenary has the virtue of finally seeing things as they are .
for a very long time , Parliament demonstrated naïve optimism on this issue .
this report is more solid than previous reports , but I regret the lack of courage shown by Parliament on the issue of the recognition of the Armenian genocide .
that is why I decided to abstain from the final vote .
for years now , I have been opposed to Turkey &quot; s joining the European Union , but I would ask for a privileged partnership to be set up with that country .
more MEPs have now adopted this position , which was still very much a minority position a few years ago .
Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States of the European Union - the Republic of Cyprus - and has been occupying it for 30 years !
Turkey does not recognise the Armenian genocide .
Turkey does not approve of freedom of association , and 97 % of its territory is situated outside Europe .
Europe has a duty to help this country on the road to democracy , but because of its geography , history and culture , Turkey cannot claim to be part of the European Union s political project . &quot;
Mr President , today &quot; s debate on the draft concerning the labelling of organic agricultural products is in line with the general global trend of an increased demand for healthy food .
we are currently having to deal with surplus food production in the countries of the European Union .
we are also witnessing a noticeable growth in the number of cases of illnesses caused by the consumption of food saturated with chemicals .
consumers are therefore choosing to buy food that is more expensive but safer .
it is not possible to produce such food in many countries because of the poor condition of significant areas of land .
neither is it possible to produce such food on large farms .
this situation represents an opportunity for countries where the soil is relatively undamaged and which have small or medium @-@ sized farms .
it also represents an opportunity to at least partly resolve the problem of unemployment in rural areas .
of course , we also have concerns regarding the introduction of unhealthy food into the European Union .
deception is very common in international trade .
we may shortly be overwhelmed by so @-@ called healthy food , originating from China for example .
the appearance on the European market of theoretically healthy food produced from genetically modifed plants poses an additional risk .
in order to deal with both cases , we should introduce provisions placing an outright ban on the importing of organic produce from outside the Union unless there is complete certainty about the quality standards under which it was produced .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , first of all , let me say that I warmly welcome the animal welfare action plan .
what I very much regret , though , is that this sort of thing should be needed in the first place .
the way in which people treat animals often reveals their true nature , an image that is still not always that agreeable .
it is still too often the case that animals are treated as commodities , with economic gain being more important than their well @-@ being .
I think that this report can at least put an end to a number of diabolical practices to which animals are subjected .
the report includes something for which I have campaigned for a very long time , namely a ban on the practice of castrating piglets without any anaesthetic , which is not satisfactory for piglets or farmers .
the fact that more active support is being demanded for research to replace animal tests by alternative test methods is a great improvement for many animals .
needless to say , I have many other ideas about animal protection that are more far @-@ reaching , for example many more free @-@ range cattle , the prevention of bull fighting , stopping the stuffing of geese with food to enlarge their livers , the banning of battery cages and far shorter transport times for animals , and I could go on for a while .
it is unfortunate that a number of sound amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety have been voted out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I should like to point out that animal welfare is certainly not just about agricultural animals ; pets and wild animals should also fall within the scope of the action plan .
I would call on everyone to let their compassionate hearts speak tomorrow in respect of our fellow creatures and give their full backing to more far @-@ reaching amendments in favour of animals .
we should demonstrate that we in this House do not behave like animals ourselves , but vote with their interests in mind .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his excellent work .
his report translates in practical terms that which has already been provided for in the report on the Solidarity Fund , which represents the legal and financial basis for intervention in the field of civil protection .
the European Union currently has financial means and new knowledge based on the experience of the Community Civil Protection Mechanism , created in 2001 , which will enable us to improve the instrument &apos;s practicality and effectiveness .
it is true that the emergency response to disasters must come first and foremost from the local level , with prevention and reconstruction measures , but it is also true that there is a need for crisis management measures , which can and should be coordinated at European level , if we want to achieve significant economies of scale and , above all , greater efficiency .
furthermore , when the scale of a disaster overwhelms the local or even national capacity to react , it would be desirable to be able to provide rapid additional assistance from other countries , using their available skills and resources .
we should in fact bear in mind that in many cases major disasters have effects that transcend borders , having an impact on the territories of neighbouring countries .
in addition , I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of proper and appropriate planning of land use and of prevention and management of disasters with a view to reducing risks .
there is a need to strengthen the European civil protection system , in order to be able to provide coordinated responses to tackle emergencies and contribute to a European Union capable of giving its own citizens confidence and safety .
I believe that we have to learn to live up to these legitimate expectations .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , today , we in this House are commemorating a tragic political event that took place in Hungary 50 years ago .
the insurrection that broke out at that time , and that was brutally crushed by Soviet troops , has opened the eyes of many in Western Europe to the dangers of the Communist ideology as dictated by Moscow .
the historical significance of Budapest 1956 is much more than local or national .
as a 13 @-@ year @-@ old schoolboy , all that I grasped was that my mother &apos;s beloved home country fought a heroic battle for a freedom that it passionately desired .
the images of Prime Minister Imre Nagy and General Pál Maléter and the fight against the Russian tanks are etched on my mind .
we desperately - against better judgment , indeed - hoped that the West would send support .
we felt so much for the victims and for the refugees .
my parents taught me back then that Hungary is not an Eastern European , but a Central European , country , with strong , religious and cultural ties with Western Europe .
now , 50 years down the line , the Soviet bloc has been dismantled and eight , and soon ten , of the former satellite states , are part of the European Union .
what have we done with this regained freedom ?
national Socialism was defeated in 1945 and Communism 45 years later .
did anything positive come to replace them ?
are we able , on the ruins of those ideologies , to build a society of tolerance , accountability and love of one &apos;s neighbour ?
we need patience and perseverance to achieve this .
since it took fifteen years for the Netherlands to be reconstructed after five years of occupation , it is likely that a few generations will be needed before all the wounds of oppression , sustained over a 50 @-@ year period , are healed .
may the Hungarian people display the courage and strength to conquer the past together and to collectively work on a future in peace and freedom .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , in our discussion of the 2006 annual report on the situation in the euro zone there are two points I would like to make .
the first is the much lower economic growth rate and higher unemployment in the countries of the European Union , and in the euro zone in particular , than in the USA and in the emerging markets such as China and India .
economic growth in the euro zone will in 2005 @-@ 2007 be almost half of that of the USA , while unemployment will be almost twice as high .
the second point is the higher economic growth rate and the lower unemployment rates in three of the fifteen countries which did not join the euro zone compared with countries inside the zone .
no wonder that those countries are not rushing to join the single currency .
the new Member States now have even greater reservations about joining the euro zone , even though they are continuing to work hard to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria .
Mr President , mercury is a highly toxic and dangerous substance .
eliminating it from all uses , especially household uses , where there are adequate substitutes is an eminently sensible proposal , supported by all 25 governments in the Council .
yet the PPE @-@ DE Group , egged on by the British Conservatives , has voted to allow extra exemptions for precisely those products which are likely to find their way into household use , which is the most dangerous place for them .
that does not square with what David Cameron is saying back home in Britain , or even with what the Conservative Party website says about its commitment to phase out dangerous chemical substances .
I hope at least that the British Conservatives , after weeks of campaigning against so @-@ called &apos; diktats &apos; from Brussels , will now refrain from using such language .
they will have seen today that the outcome of European legislation is being determined by a democratic vote in this Parliament , rather than by European Commission &apos; diktats &apos; .
even if they express no regret over what they have done today , I hope they will at least desist from using that sort of vocabulary when campaigning on such issues .
( FI ) Madam President , Commissioner , our competitiveness and prosperity depend on our ability to develop sustainably .
research and innovation are therefore essential .
new energy efficiency technologies such as hydrogen , fusion , LED light , and solar and wind power are important , for example .
energy consumption in Europe is growing , even though it should be falling .
we cannot live like this .
the high cost of energy hits the poorest .
in my view , the Commission should establish a social programme for the supply of energy for our poorest citizens .
it is said that without solidarity there will be no Union .
I suggest introducing a barometer to gauge solidarity throughout the EU .
in addition to the results of opinion polls and internal market infringement proceedings , Eurostat and the Commission should publish a wider comparative evaluation of the Member States .
we need to find out openly and simply and in comparative format to what extent countries are fulfilling their promises - in other words , how much solidarity there is between us .
the schemers should be penalised .
is the publication of a solidarity barometer appropriate and necessary ?
what does Commission Vice @-@ President Wallström think ?
it might at least help the public understand better what is going on .
it is important that we get the framework programme on research and development through , and certain other programmes as well .
Member of the Commission .
Mr President , after the post @-@ 2005 election crisis the Commission , in close cooperation with the EU Member States and the international community , undertook efforts to defuse tensions and urged the Ethiopian Government to restore confidence in the democratisation process through the release of political detainees .
the EU , in line with the international donor community , has given priority to maintaining an open and structured dialogue with the Ethiopian Government as the most appropriate way towards improving the situation .
following a visit to key political detainees , Commissioner Michel received commitments from Prime Minister Meles Zenawi during a dialogue in February that they would get a short and fair trial .
President Barroso met Prime Minister Zenawi in Addis Ababa last October to express the Commission &apos;s concerns about the trial and the prisoners .
President Barroso pointed out that he expected the trial to be speedy , fair and transparent .
he also stressed that he did not consider a trial to be an appropriate response to the Ethiopian political differences .
instead , he suggested reconciliation and dialogue as the only way forward in building confidence .
when two members of the Commission delegation were arrested and expelled from Ethiopia and a local employee of the delegation was arrested , President Barroso , Commissioner Michel and EU Member States immediately expressed their deep concern at these events , which clearly breached the Vienna Convention .
the Commission strongly refuted the accusation against the Commission delegation and its staff .
the Commission headquarters expressed its support and solidarity with the delegation staff and we were satisfied that this immediate and strong reaction resulted in the release of the arrested local agent on bail .
there have been some doubts as to the wisdom of inviting Prime Minister Zenawi to the European Development Days .
the Commission believes that dialogue and further efforts have to be pursued to convey EU concerns to the Ethiopian Government and to obtain commitments on democratic reforms and good governance .
the meetings and debates planned for the European Development Days will provide an opportunity to convey these messages directly and express our deep concerns .
( CS ) Madam President , Commissioner , I should like to thank Mr Mitchell and the coordinators , and to congratulate them for managing to assert , through shared moral values , the will of a directly elected Parliament , which they have achieved in part thanks to our support .
development cooperation must lead to development and not to stagnation .
it must lead to the rule of law , to the development of a free economy and , in turn , to pluralism in decision @-@ making and respect for human rights .
as many countries in the world have shown , economic development is not in itself sufficient .
the pursuit of economic openness and rapid economic development is not enough when , in the absence of the rule of law , there is political stagnation , a closed society , corruption and the usurpation of power .
economic development of this kind leads to serious political failures and security problems , and ends in terrorism .
we in Parliament have at our disposal an instrument whereby we can place conditions on development aid , guiding and earmarking it so that criteria are properly met and genuine development is achieved .
this instrument lays down precise financial conditions and provides for precisely controlled funding for development programmes , including those of non @-@ state beneficiaries and local authorities .
with everyone better off , it will be possible for Parliament to influence the final form of national strategic documents and to assess their implementation .
speaking as a member of the Executive Committee of the World Movement for Democracy , I welcome the possibility of promoting genuine democracy via our democratically elected Parliament .
I should just like to promise that , in common with the other Members of this House , I shall make every effort to ensure that we work effectively in conjunction with the Commission and the Council to achieve development throughout the world .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , this report presents many positive things about the EU , for instance what it is doing to promote human rights and democracy .
however , the report has several glaring omissions - more than I can mention , so I will confine myself to the subject of China .
China is the only country in the world where the suicide rate is higher for women than for men .
approximately 500 women commit suicide in China every day , and yet the report does not say one word about China &apos;s &apos; one child &apos; policy , which denies women the right to make real choices in their lives .
what is more , it says nothing about disabled people in China .
I met with a disability group when I was there last year , and everything pointed to the fact that people with disabilities like Down &apos;s Syndrome are simply eliminated before or after birth .
in China the children of prisoners are ostracised by the Government and by society and they often - indeed , usually - have a worse chance of survival than their parents in prison .
and those parents may have been imprisoned for any reason .
when you allow this kind of omission and , at the same time , sit down at friendly trade negotiations with China , you are in danger of signalling EU approval .
( ES ) Mr President , I have been taking part in budgetary debates for twelve years and I have never seen a President of Parliament withdraw the microphone from the main rapporteur .
I believe that your manner of presiding in this case has been rather unfortunate .
I would like to congratulate the four rapporteurs on their reports and on the consensuses that they have achieved under particularly difficult conditions .
my political group placed particular emphasis on the quality of spending - value for money - and on the parallel negotiation of a review of the Financial Regulation .
in both cases we hope for a satisfactory resolution following the vote on Thursday .
at a time of great budgetary restriction , with budgets of around 1 % , the only way this Parliament can improve the efficiency of Community policies is to set up an in @-@ depth assessment of the resources applied and the results achieved .
I believe that this &apos; value for money &apos; approach will be widely applied in the future .
as a complement to this approach , we have the review of the Financial Regulation , which we need in order to increase the spending discipline of the Member States and of the Commission itself .
with regard to payments , I must point out that this is a budget that has been very cheap for the Council and that may be insufficient for the European Union , but it is the case that in the years to come Parliament will be much more demanding in terms of obtaining a sufficient level of payments to meet our commitments .
I shall end by considering what the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has said about the effectiveness and the responsibilities of each of the institutions : we are demonstrating them .
we are a particularly responsible institution and therefore from the outset we have supported the posts in the Commission and we have rejected the Presidency &apos;s approach .
in writing . - ( FR ) I am among those who believe that this Globalisation Adjustment Fund is totally superfluous , if not counterproductive : it is the prototype of a bad &apos; good idea &apos; , but once such an idea has been floated , it is difficult to stop it .
we have Structural Funds , we have the European Social Fund and other funds that operate and that are perfectly equipped to respond to the challenges and the consequences of restructuring , which is linked to relocation , which itself is arguably linked to globalisation .
what is totally absurd is that some amendments propose assigning objectives to this fund that will not contribute to the structural reform @-@ related improvement of Europe &apos;s competitiveness and that are unachievable in the context of this fund .
I know that any opposition to this fund may be interpreted as insensitivity to the negative effects of globalisation @-@ related relocations .
that interpretation is unjustified , so conscious are we of Europeans &apos; fears regarding globalisation .
we want to remedy the situation with constructive structural reforms and not with a fund that gives an excellent excuse to businesses and leaves them with a clear conscience .
the fund actually implicitly encourages them to relocate because they no longer have to worry about the negative effects on employment in the EU .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , the military coup in Fiji has brought a country which is undergoing a tragic development to the attention of worldwide public opinion .
the economic situation in Fiji has also been worsened as a result of the EU &apos;s policy regarding sugar .
in the meantime , according to German radio , credit transfers from Iraq for the Fijian economy are no longer conceivable .
these ensure the survival of entire families and rural communities and , in the meantime , more money is arriving in Fiji from Iraq than is being generated by the local sugar industry .
how has this situation come about ?
in Iraq , there are very many mercenaries from Fiji who make their money there and then return as individuals , some of whom have been heavily traumatised .
the military , which has become independent after a fashion , has played a role .
the talk is always of how the conflict in Fiji runs along ethnic lines .
whilst , superficially , it may perhaps be considered an ethnic conflict , essentially , it is a question of power .
which chieftains have a say ?
moreover , this conflict between the various clans is happening as we speak .
this coup d &apos;état essentially points to the fact that conditions there are unstable .
it is also to do with the fact that the conflict is a post @-@ colonial one .
here is a brief recap : since 1879 , the British colonial administration has been bringing Indians from the subcontinent to work in Fiji , primarily in the cotton and sugar cane industries .
consequently , this is one of the prevailing conflicts between the various ethnic groups .
when the EU now talks about condemning this military coup d &apos;état , something I wish to emphasise , we must also concede at the same time that the EU has made a not insignificant contribution to the causes of the conflict in Fiji .
we should also bear this in mind .
( FR ) Mr President , I would like to congratulate you most warmly .
you ran a very good race .
11 October 2006 was a very dark day for the French railways and for the Luxembourg railways .
on a twin @-@ track section of line , temporarily being used as a single track as a result of works , a collision between two trains killed six people and seriously wounded two .
a passenger train from Luxembourg collided with a freight train in French territory .
the accident , which , according to the enquiry , was due to a human signalling error on the Luxembourg side , was particularly tragic , since the signalman , having become aware of the error , triggered via the station to train radio an initial piercing alarm , which did not reach the driver of the passenger train .
he then wanted to switch off the current on the line , but it was not possible due to the difference in power supply between the two countries .
furthermore , the Luxembourg train had already entered the French network and was therefore out of his reach .
Commissioner , this example illustrates the danger of a lack of coordination between rail networks , whether they be privatised or still under the public service system .
the responsibility falls as much to the signalman as to the two companies and the authorities of the two Member States , and also to the lack of a sustained will to make rail networks interoperable .
the citizens will not find it acceptable that , by crossing the border by train , they are risking their lives as a result of inadequate systems .
for Luxembourg , international traffic represents 70 % of its turnover .
our situation is therefore a special one , and even more efforts are required in order to achieve interoperability of networks .
this is a key priority .
if our Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport &apos;s approach leads to investments in the railways , then that is the right path to take .
( PL ) Mr President , we have lived with the threat posed by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for many years now .
we have become even more aware of it in recent times because of the danger that fissile material and chemical or biological weapons might fall into terrorist hands .
this fear has resulted in strategic documents drawn up both by the European Union and by other international organisations .
in particular , I would like to draw attention to the Comprehensive Political Guidance adopted by NATO at the end of last year .
the nuclear aspirations of certain countries , notably North Korea and Iran , have also given rise to concern as was mentioned earlier .
we are pleased to note that some progress has been made in the multilateral negotiations with North Korea and regret the lack of progress in the negotiations with Iran .
it appears that four conditions must be met if the very serious threat posed by proliferation is to be overcome .
firstly , the current non @-@ proliferation regime in the framework of the Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty must be maintained and perhaps even strengthened in 2010 on the occasion of the review conference .
I endorse the call for the European Union Member States to speak with one voice at that conference .
their determination and cohesive approach are required .
secondly , it is important for the alliance between Europe and the United States to continue combating terrorism consistently .
thirdly , it is important for the negotiations with North Korea to prove effective and to maintain the diplomatic approach to Iran .
fourthly , contrary to the opinions of certain Members on the Left , it is important to create an anti @-@ missile shield that will defend not only the United States but also its European allies from strategic missile attacks .
it is important for this shield to have an interoperative system protecting against short and medium @-@ range missiles and for the system to be a joint one .
the TBMD project that NATO is to complete by 2010 is therefore of vital importance .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr Hasse Ferreira is right when he states that social services of general interest are a key component of the European social model , based as it is on the protection of the most vulnerable members of society : children , the elderly , the sick , disabled people , the unemployed and so on .
three developments are today undermining this social model .
firstly , the uncontrolled immigration that is in the process of ruining our social security systems .
thus , in France , the granting of free State medical aid to illegal immigrants costs EUR 600 million per year .
secondly , the destruction of borders which , by leaving our businesses to the mercy of international competition and social dumping , especially in China , is destroying the economic substructure of this social model .
thirdly , the gradual abolition of public services , as decided in 2000 during the Lisbon European Summit .
the report by our fellow Member , Mr Hasse Ferreira , does not propose any solutions because these developments are the result of the ultra @-@ liberal ideology implemented by the Europe of Brussels .
only another Europe , the Europe of nations , based on respect for national sovereignties , Community preference and borders protecting it from uncontrolled immigration and unfair international competition , will enable our nations to re @-@ build a European social model .
Mr President , there are many European families with members suffering from serious diseases .
there are also many medical researchers and therapists with the means to help those patients , and they are all waiting for this important piece of legislation .
it will provide the common legislative framework which will make these innovative therapies more readily , more widely and more safely available .
it is urgently required , it will be of great benefit and there is no reason for delaying its implementation by loading it with unnecessary ethical provisos and carve @-@ outs that are impossible to agree with the Council .
it has been firmly established that ethical restrictions are properly within the power of individual Member States if they wish to limit or forbid .
subsidiarity is the essential rule .
but there is every reason to have a European standard for regulating the safe use of such therapies where they are used .
so I ask my colleagues , and particularly my good friend the rapporteur , to let this vitally important piece of legislation proceed this week , so that agreement with the Council can be reached .
many of our less fortunate fellow Europeans will thank us when this legislation comes into effect , but they will have great difficulty understanding if it is further delayed , emasculated or stopped altogether by this Parliament .
this is one of those occasions when it is really important for us to exercise our powers carefully and responsibly and let this matter be finalised .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs , and I can assure them that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe shares their view .
we too support the discharge as it has been recommended .
the year under consideration - 2006 - is the first full budgetary year for which this Commission has to take full responsibility .
we have once again received a negative verdict from the Court of Auditors , for the twelfth time in a row , and everyone knows , of course , that things cannot go on like this .
I am pleased that the Court of Auditors has announced that a peer review will be organised , that they will let others take a closer look at their own activities , their own method .
this is all very well , but no matter how you look at it , the buck still stops with the Commission and it cannot pass it on to the Member States .
last year , we signed the financial perspectives and for the first time , they contained a provision that the Member States must make national declarations at a suitable political level to declare that they have implemented the budget properly .
my big question is : what exactly has the Commission done with this article in the financial perspectives ?
did it issue a letter to the Member States to make them aware of this ?
what is the Commission &apos;s strategy in this matter ?
I should also like to draw the Commission &apos;s attention to the fact that next year will be the crucial year for the Commission .
in 2008 , it will be ten years ago , in 1998 , when Parliament refused to grant discharge .
I will certainly not go so far as to say that this will happen again ; this will depend on how things pan out , but there must be clear progress .
it is unacceptable for this Parliament , in a year &apos;s time , on the eve of the next European elections , to grant the Commission discharge once again without the slightest hesitation , when it is obvious that the Commission has not done everything in its power to improve the situation .
one of the keys to overcome this is to abide by the financial perspectives .
Mr President , I am very much obliged to those Members of Parliament who have spoken for their inspiring contributions .
what I sense in this House - and I would not have expected it to be any other way - is an atmosphere of inspiration , one in which the European ideals are considered in the context of the Europe of the 21st century .
this is why I was so moved by what Mr Daul said - and this may well be what matters more than anything - about the values that have made Europe what it is today , the values which Europe stands for and the values for which we shoulder responsibility worldwide : peace , security , democracy , human rights and solidarity .
these have made Europe strong , and that is what we need at the moment .
this is perhaps where I should like pick up on what Mr Schulz said earlier .
( DE ) It really is very good that we should meet again ;
I well remember our previous meetings .
it was really great to discuss things with you , it is so still today , and for that I am very grateful .
( NL ) He spoke about the international aspects , the foreign aspects of the European Union , and I can do no other than endorse what he said .
we live in a world in which changes are on the way - in China , India and the United States .
we see changes in the areas of security , the fight against terrorism , the climate issue and energy .
Europe can do better , work more effectively and speak more with one voice in all these areas .
discussion of what the High Representative is to be called can wait until later , but what is important is the content and the message of the values Mr Daul mentioned .
let us propagate these , and let us do it together .
these are issues that say something about our ideals involving the Europe of the future , not only here and on our own continent , but worldwide .
Mr Daul made a plea for this , which strikes me as appropriate and necessary .
this brings me to the point Mr Watson made , namely that of energy .
I should like to repeat what he said in this connection : we cannot do without one another .
if Europe does not speak with one voice , we will face big problems .
energy is not just a matter of its presence , energy is also related to stability .
stability involving the supply of energy has an economic , social and ecological dimension .
we need each other on this level too .
listening carefully to what Mr Watson said , which is what I did , I can see a connection between the European ideals , the way in which Europe presents itself to the outside world , foreign policy , and the way in which it tackles specific issues which we advocate , such as the energy issue to which he referred .
if you think about this long and hard , then Europe faces a huge task .
I liked the comparison that Mr Watson drew with the Netherlands of the 17th century , the Golden Century .
an era in which the Netherlands did extremely well worldwide .
did all of this come out of nothing ?
no , it did not .
in order to achieve this , we had to take action .
we needed to sail the seven seas and have a sound administrative structure in place .
did this happen overnight ?
no , indeed not ; it took time .
what we did have , though , is determination in terms of wanting to achieve certain things together .
if this is what you refer to , then you have touched a soft spot in me , because it brings up the question : how do we give shape to the Europe of the 21st century ?
how can we ensure that Europe can perform in the areas of economy , energy and global relations ?
the key question today is : are the existing relations adequate ?
no , they are not .
the Treaty of Nice is not enough to meet the requirements of the 21st century .
this , of course , begs the question : what is the best way ?
then you face the problem that we in Europe have Member States that have approved the constitution , those that have said &apos; no &apos; and countries that have not yet taken a decision .
this is the reality .
the last few years - the time of reflection - have not been in vain .
I think that we have given answers to the citizens .
we have said , let us work on the concrete projects in Europe .
make it clear to the people how important Europe is , so that Europe can return to people &apos;s minds and hearts .
we have spoken about the process of enlargement .
let us turn this into a credible project .
let us carefully consider the criteria that have already been tightened up .
that too is a question of the European project being credible .
we have said , let us tackle those topics that are so critical to the people in Europe .
namely energy and the climate .
this is also why , together with Tony Blair , I have written a letter to my colleagues to say that we want the topics of climate and energy high on the European agenda .
they are also matters of concern to you .
we cannot do without one another .
let Europe prove what it can do .
that is when the period of reflection will come into its own .
it should not be the case though , and I would like to make this quite clear , that at the end of the period of reflection , we end up with a climate in which one group is pitted against the other , in which the group of the 18 ratifying countries is pitted against those that said &apos; no &apos; .
if we were to do this , then we will not resolve the situation .
it is my sincere conviction that it is possible to find solutions .
let us do this in a way with which we can all identify .
this is , as I see it , the method of constitutional amendment , as we have done before , a viable route , because it is possible to embrace the sound elements from the Constitutional Treaty .
because those elements of an institutional compromise should play a key role .
because we cannot leave things the way they are .
needless to say , we have to look at the various sections .
Mrs Buitenweg made a comment on the Charter of fundamental rights , which is very sensitive here , and I can see why .
if you talk about the Charter , then you can join our camp , because we are equally persuaded of the importance of fundamental rights .
except , what do we see ?
the question is whether all of this should be included in such a Constitution , or if it would be possible to refer to it using different means .
this is the point .
so let us discuss the significance of fundamental rights , whilst considering the limitations of a Constitution .
this is a debate that I should like to enter into with you .
it is my sincere conviction that we must make haste .
my dream and ideal is that in June , we will be able to say that we will draw up a well @-@ defined time table to resolve the issues .
we would like to resolve them within a few years , and that is possible only if we join forces .
I have made suggestions to this effect in my presentation .
I argued against a Constitution , but in favour of an amending treaty instead , taking into account the role of the national parliaments without impinging on the role of the European Parliament , because your role is indispensable in Europe .
I have mentioned these elements , and we must be able to act in unison , to consider what unites us rather than what divides us ; that is where Mr Schulz is quite right , and we have to want to strike compromises .
this applies to us all .
if we manage to pull it off , then we can make progress ; that is my plan .
I am also doing this with the feeling and conviction that we must make sure we only talk about a &apos; no &apos; of two countries , because feelings among citizens and concerns are a reality .
we must answer the questions that are around today .
if we do this from a position that we want to find a common solution , draw short @-@ term conclusions , check what is needed for this , and I have made a contribution to this , then it is possible to find solutions .
indeed , what is unacceptable in a time of further globalisation , of social issues , is that we would be unable to find answers , because the division that was would simply carry on .
I think we owe it to the founding fathers of the European Union , Adenauer , Schuman , de Gasperi , Monnet and all the others , to hold steadfast to the ideals , and , as Mr Daul said , to keep the value of Europe , the European dream in mind at all times - not to overlook public concerns , but do what has to be done .
if we draw these conclusions in June , then we will have achieved a great deal .
for this , we need each other , and I also think that we owe it to the ideals that we seek to achieve .
Mr President , I was inspired by what you said .
I will take your words to the Netherlands , and then we shall all have the task of finding solutions quickly , taking into consideration each other &apos;s positions , but always considering what we need to keep at the forefront of our minds , namely working on a European dream in the 21st century .
( NL ) Prime Minister Balkenende , you have shown courage to walk into the lion &apos;s den in order to clarify the Dutch position .
I think you came across convincingly - certainly in your first response just now - as you underlined the European calling of the Netherlands .
with this , a new Treaty is moving closer , and this is important , because we need one , for things are just not going well enough at the moment .
we need more transparency , more democracy , hence more powers for the European Parliament and , as you quite rightly stated , for the national parliaments .
things have to be done more effectively , so that we can really address issues such as climate change , energy policy , immigration and reinforcing Europe &apos;s role in the world .
I can understand the principles and your main issues in those discussions .
what is called for , in the final analysis , is a pragmatic attitude , for it is in the European and national interest that we find a way out of this impasse .
having , as I do , some background knowledge of you as a person , I can say , in response to what was said earlier , that I have every confidence in your ability to do this .
you are not a nationalist and I also know that you are not lying .
by way of final comment , you claim that you support the internal market .
I am pleased that you do , but then you should also put your money where your mouth is .
if all 27 Member States make exceptions to the internal market , and it is looking this way in the Netherlands , as is evident from the discussions there , then we will be left with no internal market , which would be detrimental to the European consumer and the European economy alike .
Mr President , I would like to put aside my prepared text and respond to some of my colleagues who spoke earlier in the debate .
Mrs McAvan tells us that this measure is designed to protect jobs , yet to the extent that it either bans or qualifies the use of the word &apos; vodka &apos; for existing brands and existing manufacturers , it seems likely to have exactly the reverse effect .
Mr Maaten asks if we have not been to see a distillery which is a craft industry .
well , Mr Maaten , yes I have .
I worked in the industry for several years and I can tell you that a malt whisky distillery is indeed a craft industry , but a vodka or grain whisky distillery is an industrial process and the process for producing vodka produces pure alcohol whether you make it from sugar or from potatoes or from anything else .
all this talk about consumer protection is nonsense .
the product is identical and the reason we should not compare vodka with whisky - or brandy , as has been rightly pointed out by my colleague on the other side of the Chamber - is because in those products , the ingredients significantly affect the flavour .
whisky is only whisky if it is made in the proper way , but vodka is based on pure alcohol .
if I may make a general point , we should not be seeking to change the established meanings of words by legislation .
however , in this case the compromise proposed by the rapporteur seems to be the best outcome on offer so I suppose that we must reluctantly support it .
as happens so often in the European Union , we have to make the best of a bad job .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as we begin this debate , which is about procedural issues , we should firstly not forget the pleasing conclusions of the Convergence Reports published by the Commission and the European Central Bank on Cyprus and Malta .
the Presidency is delighted that the Commission was able to establish that Cyprus and Malta have reached a high level of durable convergence and that , on this basis , it has been able to table proposals for the euro to be introduced in these two countries .
at the meeting of the Economic and Financial Council on 5 June 2007 , ministers endorsed the Commission &apos;s assessment that Cyprus and Malta meet the conditions for the euro to be introduced .
the Presidency would therefore be very glad if Cyprus and Malta &apos;s success were not overshadowed by procedural issues and if the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council could reach an amicable solution .
it is in all of our interests to avoid delaying or creating any uncertainty about the technical and legal preparations that Cyprus and Malta need to make for the introduction of the euro .
I should particularly like to thank the European Parliament for its willingness to cooperate .
the Presidency has sympathy for the European Parliament &apos;s concerns and understands why it wants to have more time to examine the Convergence Reports and the Commission &apos;s proposals for Council decisions on the introduction of the euro .
however , the Council and the Presidency are bound by the procedure laid down in the EC Treaty .
the timetable is essentially determined by the rules laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact , including the Maastricht reporting regulation .
the Council &apos;s obligation to consult the European Parliament on proposals for the euro to be introduced in Member States is laid down in Article 122 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty .
the Presidency believes that the Council has respected this provision of the EC Treaty in the cases of Cyprus and Malta .
the Council received both Commission proposals for Council decisions on 21 and 22 May 2007 , each in three language versions .
the remaining language versions were transmitted to the Council in the course of the subsequent two weeks .
on 25 May the Council consulted the European Parliament on the two Commission proposals .
in its request for consultation , the Council referred to the fact that it would be helpful if the European Parliament could adopt its opinions on the Commission proposals at its plenary session from 18 to 21 June .
these opinions could then be made available to the Council , meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government , on 21 June 2007 .
although it is not a legal requirement , the Presidency would be pleased if the discussion of the Heads of State or Government could also take into account the European Parliament &apos;s position .
in any case , the Council cannot adopt its two decisions on the introduction of the euro until the European Parliament &apos;s opinions have been provided .
in principle , the Presidency supports the proposals made by President Barroso in his letter of 13 June 2007 in response to President Pöttering &apos;s letter .
the Presidency believes - as the Council President , Mrs Angela Merkel , explained in a letter to the President of the European Parliament on 19 June - that this matter primarily concerns the Commission and the European Parliament .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , The debate on liberalising the postal services has taken up a lot of our time today .
it also shows that it is typically in the field of services that liberalisation is attended by an increase in precarious labour relations .
in the face of such developments , everybody expects the Commission to support workers &apos; rights in a Green Paper on workers &apos; rights , to set minimum standards at European level to prevent workers &apos; rights from going into freefall , and to strengthen trade union representation and social dialogue .
instead , the Commission &apos;s Green Paper starts talking about ideas of Flexicurity , which opens the floodgates to social dumping , which has caused bitter disappointment and will lead to a rise in Euroscepticism .
this House has made a clear amendment here : worker &apos;s rights are not exclusive , but apply to all employees , regardless of what their collective bargaining situation is .
more flexibility is only possible if there is greater security . this is the only way in which the report can be further developed .
Madam President , I want to congratulate Commissioner Borg on this very welcome and visionary action plan addressing specifically the fisheries points which are of interest to me : the integrated network for maritime surveillance , which I think is absolutely vital if we are going to improve safety and stamp out illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing ; the plan to stop destructive bottom trawling in the high seas ; the plan to improve the conditions of the people who work in the fishing industry , one of the most dangerous and poorly paid jobs in the EU ; the improved cooperation between coastguards ; the ending of discards and the promotion of aquaculture , which provides 65 000 full @-@ time jobs in the EU - all of these are wonderful .
I particularly like the idea of the road map towards maritime spatial planning and my question is on that specific issue .
who will pay for this ?
some Member States have already done this .
they already have spatial plans for their maritime areas .
I think there will be a commercial value for these maritime spatial plans .
who is going to pay for it in the mean time ?
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , violence against women in Mexico and Central America has , in recent years , reached dramatic proportions , with thousands of women having been the victims of violent deaths , which on many occasions have been extremely cruel in nature and often accompanied by sexual abuse and torture .
although in many cases the perpetrators of such atrocious crimes are sick @-@ minded individuals , in many situations organised criminal activity is very much involved , and the implication of human trafficking , prostitution and drugs is largely in evidence .
it is very sad that in Mexico and Central American countries the functioning of the rule of law in certain cases leaves a lot to be desired , either because of real organisational deficiencies in the police and judiciary systems , or because of corruption and impunity .
the rapporteur , Mr Romeva i Rueda , is to be congratulated for making sure that this report is strong enough to send the necessary message not only to the governments of the countries concerned , but also to the world as a whole , about the totally unacceptable high level of femicides in the aforementioned states .
the small number of final amendments - which incidentally have the rapporteur &apos;s full support - are useful and make this report more complete .
my group fully supports all those amendments .
it is to be hoped that this report will be voted through this House with a very large majority , so as to give a very clear signal to all concerned that the problem of the killing of women in Central America , as indeed in other parts of the world , is a matter that should attract our full attention and necessitates the taking of very drastic and effective remedial measures .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , despite voting in favour of the Breyer report as a whole , I considered it expedient to support a few amendments designed to modify the original draft .
it is essential that we break up the monopoly of large multinationals in the field of data sharing and access , and open up the sector to increased and fairer competition .
on the other hand , this sector is affected by geographical and environmental differences , which must be given due consideration .
what we need is greater flexibility in terms of mutual recognition and comparative evaluation of substances .
currently in fact , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which mainly produce co @-@ formulants , are denied room for manoeuvre precisely because of the excessive power of the major industrial groups - and not just in data management and exchange either .
European legislation must absolutely take into account and support their requests to prevent their slow but inexorable disappearance from the market .
in writing . - ( FR ) historically used to protect plants against various parasites , pesticides have transformed agriculture considerably .
nevertheless , today we are seeing that the massive use of these pesticides in agricultural and non @-@ agricultural environments has a damaging effect on the environment ( pollution of water , air , soil , etc . ) and also on health ( development of some cancers , fertility problems ) .
in view of this , the EU has decided to modify its legislation with a view to encouraging a reduction in the use of pesticides .
within the framework particularly of the Breyer report concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and the sustainable use of pesticides , I voted in favour of setting up strict criteria for all toxic substances ( neurotoxic , bioaccumulative , carcinogenic , etc . )
similarly , out of consistency with France &apos;s National Pesticide Plan and REACH , I also supported a 50 % reduction by 2013 in the use of extremely worrying pesticides and the replacement of the most dangerous substances with safer substitutes ( including non @-@ chemical products ) .
finally , in conformity with the spirit of the national debate in France on the environment , I voted in favour of a tax on pesticides to encourage our farmers to reduce their use of treatment products .
on behalf of the ITS Group - ( BG ) Mme Chairperson , Colleagues , It is gratifying to note that such a famous and prominent name in world sports as Pál Schmitt has contriubuted his authority to raise a very important issue for the future of Europeans before the European Parliament .
for the attitude to sports is , in fact , attitude to the health of people in united Europe .
I feel honoured and proud to speak on his report as an athlete , as a representative of an ancient people with immense sport spirit , and also as a person concerned with the future of children in united Europe , the future of our children .
in my opinion , things are crystal clear : more sports at school , less drugs at school ; more spending for sports at school , less spending for healthcare because it is perfectly obvious that it is ten times better for our children to be happy than to be better cured ; more sports competition at the earliest age , less aggression in the other spheres of life ; more international sporets races involving school children , less inter @-@ ethnic and inter @-@ state tensions in the European Union and in the world at large .
therefore , bacause of the time constraint , I would like to highlight those aspects that need further development on the basis of the report by the champion and highly respected athlete and politician Pál Schmitt .
I would like to see a recommendation of the European Parliament to all Member States to increase the number of sports classes at school to five hours a week .
I suggest that the European Parliament think seriously and include in its future budget a proposal to organise international competitions under its auspices for schoolchildren in some sports that are most useful to adolescents .
the report points out that sports at school is unattractive .
have you ever thought why football is attractive ?
because football players are stars .
let us have Europe single out its school sport stars in various areas !
thus will shall give much more publicity to sports at school that a directive or a recommendation could possibly give .
they will be European school champions in athletics , football and basketball , martial arts or swimming .
in this way , we might not be able to restore the Spartan ideal of a healthy spirit in a healthy body , mens sana in corporare sano , in its authentic meaning , but we shall contribute much more than a report could contribute .
the decision to hold youth Olympics in 2010 follows these lines but the Olympic spirit cannot prevail in school sports if we rely only on the four @-@ year Olympic cycle .
we should use time in between more intensively by offering a meaningful sports calendar for school children .
the European Parliament should make special efforts to prevent the spread of drugs through sports at school .
in closing , I believe that the uderstanding of this Parliament about sports at the earliest age bodes well for the future ...
( the Chairperson iterrupts the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , I voted in favour of the Hegyi report because we have repeatedly criticised the democratic deficit that exists with regard to genetically modified organisms .
we know that a proper decision for or against the authorisation of GMOs has scarcely ever been taken by the Council or the Committee of Permanent Representatives .
it has always been more or less the same story of the European Commission exercising its responsibility for risk management by authorising GMOs against the will of the EU population and in spite of the reservations of many Member States and experts .
the European Commission cannot be allowed to have the final say .
its decisions must be subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament .
although Mr Hegyi &apos;s report goes in the right direction by insisting on a binding parliamentary right of codecision on GMO authorisations , we reject the negotiated compromise , because it leaves the undemocratic comitology procedure in place .
there can really be only one solution , namely codecision rights for the European Parliament in all matters relating to GMO licensing .
I therefore find it rather regrettable that we have not made the most of this vote and grasped the opportunity at long last to exert more pressure against the continued existence of this democratic deficit .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Costa on amendment of the agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on certain aspects of air services .
this relates to a proposal for a Council decision on agreeing a Protocol amending the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on certain aspects of air services to take account of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Romania .
the Protocol provides for essential changes to bilateral agreements on air services between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Romania pursuant to the accession of the latter two countries to the European Union .
both Bulgaria and Romania had previously concluded agreements on air services with Morocco , in 1966 and 1971 respectively .
the European Community , however , concluded a horizontal agreement in December 2006 .
it is therefore necessary to adjust the agreements to Community legislation and enable both new Member States to accede to the horizontal agreement .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to express my fundamental disagreement with the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98 / 71 / EC on the legal protection of designs .
my disagreement concerns the proposal as a whole , not just some minor problems with the Commission &apos;s proposal .
the proposal aims to deal with competition problems in the automotive industry by an unprecedented curtailment of the legal protection that industrial design rights afford to spare parts .
such an approach flies in the face not only of the Lisbon Strategy but also of the universally accepted and frequently evoked trend towards a greater protection of intellectual property rights , including their enforcement .
it is a proven fact that there are no reasons , either economic or legal or with regard to employment , for restricting the rights of design right holders .
I should also like to point out the fact that every economy benefits from the monopoly allowed by the legal protection of designs as this promotes more growth .
in addition , account should be taken of the principle that intellectual property rights , including design rights , can only be restricted under exceptional circumstances in matters of public interest , which is certainly note the case here .
the negative consequences of this directive , if adopted , would be felt most strongly in the European automotive industry .
there are ample arguments to suggest that liberalisation of the spare parts aftermarket as proposed by the Commission would actually harm the consumer by introducing low quality and dangerous parts into the market .
if the so @-@ called independent producers were to produce standard parts of high quality , thereby requiring advanced technology , such production would not be economically attractive to them .
the excessive nature of the proposed directive can be illustrated by the curious and incomprehensible opinion expressed by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , which on the one hand supports the proposal as a whole in the name of the sacred slogan of liberalisation of the internal aftermarket , while on the other it says that &apos; the abolition of design protection is contrary to internationally recognised principles of intellectual property protection and would constitute a dangerous precedent for the protection of intellectual property rights in other areas as well at a time when the European Union has undertaken , in particular within the WTO , to press for the acceptance by third countries of a protection regime for intellectual property rights which would put an end to imitation and counterfeiting &apos; .
that really needs no further comment .
( PL ) Mr President , the political situation in the Balkans has been a subject of special interest to this Parliament for many years .
we are happy that , after a period of bloody conflicts , peace and cooperation between nations are now the norm in the daily life of the region .
even the most sensitive issues , such as declarations of independence by new states , now take place , or can take place , in a manner and form complying with the highest international standards .
that is the real trend in the political development of the Balkans , a trend that creates the possibility to achieve the strategic goal of the majority of nations living in the region , namely closer cooperation with the European Union , up to and including full membership .
Montenegro is an excellent example of this trend .
after declaring independence , it maintained good relations with its nearest neighbours , including the Republic of Serbia , with which it had previously been joined in a federation .
it immediately began intensive negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement , which culminated in the signing of the Agreement on 15 October of this year .
in parallel , it concluded a free @-@ trade agreement with the EU that will enter into force in January .
in the course of this short period of time , barely one and a half years , Montenegro has made appreciable progress .
the changes made in fiscal and taxation policy , and in establishing a market economy based on competition and the free movement of capital , must be seen as positive achievements .
there is still much to be done , especially in the fields of social policy and employment , energy and protection of the environment , and security and civil rights .
an effective fight against corruption and organised crime and full cooperation with the International Tribunal in the Hague are particularly important tasks facing the government of Montenegro .
Montenegro , however , is not alone in facing these problems .
similar challenges face all Balkan countries applying for membership of the European Union .
Montenegro is one of the leaders in this process , and I would like here to express the hope that it will remain so .
the Union is prepared to welcome the Balkan countries into the community .
whether and when that happens depends , above all , on the Balkan elite and the wisdom of Balkan politicians .
Madam President , I should just like to acknowledge how patient you have been during these explanations of vote .
thank you very much for laughing at some of the jokes as well .
you may be aware that I represent London , the greatest city in the world , capital of the greatest country in the world .
in London there are a number of educational institutions .
I myself went to school in London ; I went to the London School of Economics to do my Master &apos;s course .
however , what I would like to say in regard to this particular explanation of vote is that we should not underestimate the role of the further education sector in lifelong learning .
in particular , there are some very excellent institutions : Bromley College , with its excellent head , Peter Jones - I would like to put that on record - and Westminster College .
we all deserve a say on the referendum on the Constitution .
Mr President , this report , in endorsing the Lisbon Treaty , clearly states that this is a substantial improvement on the existing Treaties , argues that it is desirable that the Treaty of Lisbon be ratified by all Member States by the end of the current year , and claims that it will provide a stable framework , allowing further development of the Union in future .
I have to say that , as a British Conservative , I sadly cannot agree with all that , but I do so in a friendly way and not from an extreme or nihilist stance , as others seem to argue from .
from the start , I have made it clear that this Treaty or Constitution is not the best way forward for Europe at this time .
Conservatives support a Europe of independent states working closely together to meet the challenges of globalisation , global poverty and global warming , as has already been stated by others .
these are the priorities , and it must be done in a cooperative fashion .
indeed my colleague , the UK Shadow Foreign Secretary , William Hague , said in a debate in London : &apos; Conservatives are the strongest advocates of a European Union where nations work together in a way that strengthens our economies , empowers our consumers and turns our common values into effective action on the great issues facing our world today . &apos;
I do not believe that what we have before us will help us particularly in that great challenge .
our eloquent rapporteurs who quote Shakespeare in their advocacy of haste , should , I think , also note King John , Act V , Scene II , where a supplicant said , &apos; According to the fair play of the world , let me have audience &apos; .
well , perhaps , in the UK , the Prime Minister should note that , and he should then allow his citizens to have their say on this undoubtedly vital matter .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I would like to thank Mr Goepel for his work , because it is important for the European Parliament to express its opinion on the general guidelines arising from the CAP &apos; Health Check &apos; .
personally , I have serious reservations about full decoupling , which carries high risks of the abandonment of production for stockbreeding and even for certain crops .
I do not share the optimism of some people who believe that the current situation on world markets guarantees a steady and secure future for European agriculture and that we should continue heading for complete liberalisation .
furthermore , not all agricultural sectors are benefiting equally from price rises , as the particularly serious crisis currently being experienced by European livestock farmers shows .
the total abandonment of any market regulation mechanism would seem to me to be hazardous for our food security and that of the world .
I think we need to make sure that we maintain intervention stocks so that we can react in the event of food shortages and speculation , maintain common market organisations ...
( the President cut off the speaker )
Member of the Commission . - Things have moved on since the Commission &apos;s update to the Committee on Development in January of this year .
the legal texts have been jointly checked for the Caribbean economic partnership agreement , and we are beginning the process leading to signature and ratification .
in other regions , we have been preparing the interim agreements for signature and have been reflecting on how to replace these with full EPAs .
I have just returned from a visit to southern and eastern Africa taking in Lesotho , South Africa , Botswana and Zambia .
I held ministerial meetings with the SADC and ESA regions , and I had extensive discussions with President Mbeki on both EPAs and the DDA , incidentally .
I was struck in all meetings with ESA and SADC by the commitment of the regions to move forward with the negotiations , not to look back and not to unravel what has been achieved , with all the disastrous implications for trade security that that unravelling would have .
this was reflected in joint declarations in which we made clear our shared commitment to agree full EPAs by the end of this year .
we have also held senior official meetings with central Africa and west Africa in recent days .
Central Africa wants a full EPA by July , and west Africa intends to reach a full EPA in mid @-@ 2009 .
finally , the Pacific region is consulting internally , but the agreed objective remains to finalise a full EPA in 2008 .
my clear sense is that most of the regions are now coming out of a period of stock @-@ taking and reflection after the developments of last December and are clearly restating their commitment to move towards full EPAs .
this is an important sign that their commitment to integrating trade and development strategies in a progressive , forward @-@ looking way .
it is a commitment I welcome .
our objectives for full EPAs for whole regions and covering the full range of trade , trade @-@ related and development issues remain unchanged .
in the mean time non @-@ LDCs like Kenya , Côte d &apos;Ivoire and others say they have protected thousands of agricultural jobs through the interim agreements , and LDCs like Tanzania and Lesotho praise improvements in rules of origin .
sensitive agricultural sectors are protected , and the ACP now have time and space to work out how to reach full regional agreements .
EPAs need to be closely monitored in both aid and trade aspects .
this is why the Caribbean EPA establishes compressive monitoring arrangements , including parliamentary and other consultative subcommittees .
the interim agreements will be replaced with full EPAs that include similar provisions before any substantive liberalisation commitments apply on the ACP side .
( NL ) I think that this report has its good points .
it gives an interesting overview of the position regarding development cooperation in the new Member States .
that is a good thing .
basically , however , I believe this report above all represents a missed opportunity .
rather than encouraging the new Member States to pursue the traditional objectives of European development aid , Parliament would actually do better to debate those same objectives and think about whether it makes sense nowadays just to continue with the traditional form of development aid .
time and time again this House elevates the financial objectives into a kind of dogma , without any proper debate , and time and time again we refuse to acknowledge the fundamental causes which are at the root of most developing countries &apos; problems .
in Africa it is certainly the case that the leading cause of poverty , hunger , insecurity and the enormous social and economic problems in developing countries is actually the fact that they are very badly governed by totally corrupt regimes .
the new Member States are being urged here to organise information and awareness @-@ raising campaigns .
I am in favour of that , but should we not also inform people of the fact that African nations spend more on arms than they receive in development aid ?
or that African rulers have billions stashed away in Swiss banks , to a total greater than many years &apos; -worth of development aid ?
if there is one signal that Europe ought to be giving out , it is that only democracies where the rule of law applies guarantee people a real chance of improving their lot , and that in those circumstances development aid will be effective and beneficial .
at the moment , sadly , it is not .
( HU ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
I would like to speak on two topics : climate change , and research and development .
Mr Barroso began by saying that the Spring Council was a moment of truth .
I suggest we continue in this vein .
the objectives , the road maps and the various policies set out in this regard by the European Union institutions are good and adequate , I believe , and the goals are as ambitious as they need to be .
the problem that I foresee is more likely to relate to their implementation .
the will to implement these goals on the part of the Member States is variable , and in many cases there is disappointingly little will to do so .
I would like to call to your attention the European Environment Agency &apos;s recent report stating that carbon dioxide emissions in Europe have not decreased since 2000 , but have increased .
I suggest we should be honest about this .
sadly , the attitude and behaviour of Member States is far from united , let alone desirable .
in practical terms , the eastern half of Europe is doing nothing .
it is operating on the basis that its industry collapsed after 1990 , and so it still has considerable reserves .
Europe &apos;s western half , rather than cutting emissions , has increased them , despite its Kyoto promises .
only a few countries - Germany , the United Kingdom and Sweden - have met their Kyoto commitments as regards reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
we must take note : being flexible is not synonymous with doing nothing .
similarly , the European Environment Agency report shows that the Member States of the European Union will have to pay EUR 2.9 billion to use the clean development mechanism - the instrument of the Kyoto Protocol - starting this year .
Europe is increasingly lagging behind as regards research and development too .
the goal of according a 3 % share of GDP to R &amp; D is no longer much more than fantasy .
the United States and Japan are forging ahead , while many Member States , my own country included , barely manage 1 % of GDP .
Wakey @-@ wakey !
the ambitious plans are in place ; now we need ambitious implementation of them .
Mr President , the core issue in the current crisis in Tibet is not only about oppression , it is also about secession .
the violence in Tibet today is not only about human rights but also about power @-@ sharing .
the lack of transparency is deplorable , as much as the provocative measures are manoeuvres .
certainly we must ask the Chinese authorities to deal with these events in compliance with respect for human rights in a civilised , transparent and proportionate way .
at the same time , we must also recognise the right of China and the right of any state to take appropriate measures to protect the lives , freedoms and fortunes of its citizens as well as the public good .
undoubtedly , China is not organised in accordance with European principles and values of democracy and human rights .
however , one cannot deny the opening @-@ up of China in a Chinese evolution convergent with some of our values .
it is our right and duty to encourage that process and to insist on respect for human rights , including cultural rights and the protection of cultural identity everywhere in China , not only in Tibet .
likewise , we should support democratic freedoms against both autocracy and theocracy .
however , in doing that , we must bear in mind that excessive pressure is more likely to slow down the reforms rather than to speed them up .
in this period , we should ask all those concerned not to make human rights the hostage of geostrategic agendas or to make the Olympic Games the hostage of political ambitions .
the Olympic Games should be a well @-@ used opportunity for us to speak about peace , freedom and human dignity all over the world , in China first and foremost .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of discharge for the Director of the Translation Centre for the bodies of the European Union in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2006 on the basis of the report by my Austrian colleague Mr Hans @-@ Peter Martin , which recommends to Parliament to give discharge .
the discharge procedure should be simplified and streamlined for the decentralised agencies , which are growing in number ( from 8 in 2000 , to 20 in 2006 ) and represent a total budget of around EUR 1 billion .
I support the request for the Commission to present a study every five years on the added value of each agency and not to hesitate to close an agency if the analysis concludes that it is not useful .
the internal audit procedures of the agencies also need urgent improvement and I support the possibility of having a common disciplinary board for all the agencies .
it is surprising to note the accumulated budget surplus of the Translation Centre of EUR 16.9 million in 2006 and that in 2007 , the Centre should reimburse around EUR 9.3 million to its clients .
this accumulation of surplus appears to show that the method that the Centre uses for pricing its translations is not precise enough .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , first of all I would like to congratulate Ms Gomes on this serious , politically very important report .
China is a global player in the contemporary world , and we would like to see China as a real partner of the European Union in the process of globalisation .
China should play an important role in the new world order and we praise the peaceful role played by China in Africa .
at the same time , China must take her responsibilities in the area of human rights and development .
in particular , China should use its influence to curb the nastiest of its friends , including the Government of Sudan .
fortunately , China has ceased to resist the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur and is sending some of its own military engineers to join the force .
on the negative side , China has still sent arms to dictatorial regimes in Africa .
just this week , Zambia , Mozambique , South Africa and Tanzania blocked attempts by a Chinese vessel to deliver a massive shipment of ammunition , mortars and other lethal armaments to President Mugabe in Zimbabwe .
these weapons could play an anti @-@ democratic , even deadly role , in the hands of the Mugabe regime .
in this report , the European Parliament calls on China to be on the side of African societies , democracy and human rights in Africa .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the dictatorial government of Mr Mugabe has transformed Zimbabwe from a country with a blossoming economy into a complete disaster .
inflation has reached 100 000 % per annum .
GNP has fallen by a third in the last few years and the decree on reducing prices by 50 % has resulted in shops being empty .
recently every single company in the country has been nationalised .
in addition , life expectancy in Zimbabwe is among the lowest in the world : 37 years for men and 34 for women .
one quarter of the population is infected with HIV and about 80 % live below the poverty line .
if we want changes in Zimbabwe to take place peacefully - and change is absolutely essential - then we have to ensure that this takes place through elections and not through bloody riots and revolution .
( SK ) Lobbying is a legitimate part of every democratic system .
wherever democracy is not to be anarchy , clear rules must also apply to lobbying .
American lobbyists consider their law to be too strict ; on the other hand , in the new Member States , no rules exist , to the point where people often think of lobbying as having negative undertones .
therefore the new EU model should be somewhere between these extremes .
my view is that the proposal to establish a common interinstitutional system for the mandatory registration of EU lobbyists , the disclosure of financial background and the &apos; legislative footprint &apos; will contribute to the transparency of rules on lobbying .
however , I also believe that after today &apos;s vote the churches will remain our partners and will not be classified as lobby groups .
I am convinced that the Stubb / Friedrich report will eliminate all kinds of prejudices and negative views about lobbying and that European citizens will view lobbyists as specialists who bring knowledge based on practical experience , helping to prevent European legislation from having a negative impact .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we in the group of the Greens / European Free Alliance warmly welcome Mrs Van Lancker &apos;s report because it would be fatal if the Council were to announce full @-@ bodied reforms in employment policy guidelines for 2008 and then say : actually , we don &apos;t want a reform !
Commissioner , you are absolutely right when you say that reform fatigue seems to have occurred at the Commission and also particularly in the Council .
the Van Lancker report , however , clearly sets the right priorities .
I should particularly like to emphasise the setting of new priorities in social integration .
it is vital that the message goes out from here that we cannot forget the people outside and that they are important to us .
secondly , we Greens have made a considerable contribution to ensuring that this Parliament report has a substantial gender mainstreaming dimension - consistently - and that family policy is not completely sold out as gender mainstreaming policy .
gender mainstreaming is broader and concerns women - not men and women , as is the case in family policy .
we Greens , however , will continue to take a discerning look at the flexicurity sector until social protection is guaranteed .
I should once again like to point out that we need reform and not stalemate .
I voted in favour of the report by my Italian fellow Member Mrs Locatelli , written under the consultation procedure on the proposal for a Council regulation setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking .
putting Europe at the forefront of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies globally is an excellent policy .
fuel cells are discreet , efficient energy converters that considerably reduce the production of greenhouse gases .
they provide great flexibility since they can consume hydrogen and other fuels such as natural gas , ethanol and methanol .
it became essential to set up a Community instrument with this Joint Technology Initiative ( JTI ) to create partnerships between the public and private sectors in the research field under the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development ( FP7 ) .
the JTIs , which mainly result from work by the European Technology Platforms ( ETPs ) reflect the EU &apos;s firm commitment to coordinate research in order to strengthen the European Research Area and achieve European objectives for competitiveness .
I support the idea of giving more assistance to SMEs .
( CS ) I did not vote for the report by my colleague Mr Florenz either .
everything that is branded , and presented , as a scientific fact must explain the scientific opinions expressed by both groups of scientists , those who agree as well as those who do not agree .
the statements in the report are presented as a clear scientific consensus .
however , this is not the case .
the opposing camp is also important .
the principle of tentative caution was often stressed during the debate .
could we not also use this in regard to overly strict and one @-@ sided conclusions concerning climate change policy ?
as a geologist I can assure you that , many times in the past , the earth has warmed up much more than by those demonised 2 ° C , and no tragic events took place .
after all , humankind has always been living in a time of continuous climatic change .
( NL ) Congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Van Hecke , for a good report .
I also thank the Commissioner for a particularly sound staff working paper for Accra .
three points .
firstly , more effective aid indeed requires the donor countries to coordinate their aid better on the basis of a country strategy in which the partner countries in the south take the lead .
however , that means that the priorities also have to be decided democratically in those countries , that is to say in cooperation with national parliaments and NGOs , which does not happen at the moment .
it seems to me absolutely essential to involve women in the dialogue .
secondly , donor countries absolutely have to stop imposing innumerable conditions on aid and staking a lot on measurable results .
the economic conditions imposed by the IMF and the World Bank in particular have to go , because they often conflict with the Millennium Goals .
I therefore say to the rapporteur that paragraph 28 in the report should go .
thirdly , better aid is no excuse for less aid .
at the moment not only is development aid falling , the figures are also confused by what is supposedly aid but is not really much help to the partner countries , such as money paid to students or refugees in Europe or cancellation of debts .
it is therefore crucial for the donor countries to stick to their promises of the 0.7 % and decide on concrete timetables .
I hope , Commissioner , that the Council on Monday listens to this message .
( NL ) Mr President , I should like to make a number of comments on the European Security Strategy in the report by my esteemed colleague Mr Kuhne . he worked on it of course with the full support of my group , and we believe the result is excellent .
nevertheless , I should also like to bring a number of observations to the attention of the High Representative .
this Security Strategy is in place and was developed in 2003 as a major innovation .
the essence of the Strategy of course remains in place .
what we are discussing now are adaptations to a transformed international agenda .
effective multilateralism is an important principle .
the combination of civil and military aspects is of major importance .
modern threat analysis is also important .
there are many positive examples of how the European Union , under the direction of Mr Solana , has dealt with this in the past few years .
it is actually the same approach , but a broader agenda is being applied .
everyone is saying that you cannot just talk about terrorism and about traditional security problems : you must also examine the way in which problems relating to energy security and climate threat are important to our security agenda .
that is the broad agenda .
I should nevertheless like to stand up for the narrow agenda .
it is not just about the security of states ; it is about the security of people also .
I think it a good thing that Mr Kuhne has tried to spark this debate here in Parliament , just as we had a whole discussion on the &apos; responsibility to protect &apos; in the UN , another discussion that concerns individuals .
we must indeed examine how this can be incorporated into our concept , and I therefore think it a shame that the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats does not wish to participate in shaping these ideas .
when we talk about human security , we mean not that there should be automatic intervention in each situation in which there is a possible threat to human security , but rather that we want better account to be taken of this important element .
with regard to this broad agenda , it is also important that , thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon - and let us hope and pray that , on 12 June , Ireland will vote in favour of this Treaty , which is what we are assuming - the European Union will be able to work with a broad agenda , because the new High Representative , who must be called as such because of my own country , will also be Vice @-@ President of the European Commission and will therefore coordinate this broad agenda effectively .
finally , I have one further observation regarding the United States .
there are to be elections , and we do not know who the two candidates will be .
in any case , it is clear that with whomever it may be - and I hope of course that it is Barack Obama - it will be easier to cooperate on a number of security issues .
a particular example is the issue of the non @-@ proliferation of nuclear weapons .
John McCain has had interesting things to say on this subject .
perhaps , at the end of the year , it will be time to present further initiatives , new agreements : with regard to the multilateralisation of the nuclear fuel cycle , for example .
I hope that the High Representative is willing to make efforts to achieve this .
Madam President , we are obviously all in favour of protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems from destructive fishing practices .
in fact , I am so much in favour of it that I would even advocate protecting them against all destructive practices , including non @-@ fishing practices .
ultimately , however , we already know that in these cases it is up to the fisheries sector to lead the way and set an example .
as I have already said in relation to the report by Mrs Miguélez on deep @-@ sea fish stocks , I think that our main concern should be to protect all vulnerable ecosystems that have been identified as such , wherever they are , not just those that are lucky enough to be below a depth of 1 000 metres .
as Mr Freitas has already said , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) has ruled out the depth criterion as being arbitrary and non @-@ scientific , and the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations ( RFMOs ) , including the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation ( NAFO ) , have even ruled out the 2 000 metre rule , without even considering a 1 000 metre limit , as in their opinion the limit would serve no purpose , so they have removed it .
however , my question , Commissioner , is as follows : you have said that this is going to be applied to the fleets that fish on the Patagonian shelf .
recently representatives of the Ocean Institute were here presenting assessment studies in which they did not detect any vulnerable marine ecosystems in that area .
I would therefore like to ask you whether you are going to continue to insist on applying this proposal to the Community fleet that fishes in that area .
finally I would like to discuss the subject of observers , regarding which I think that the report by Mr Freitas has provided a considerable dose of reason .
I think , and I am in agreement with the report , that it is important to have observers who are scientists , as they have to evaluate vulnerable marine ecosystems , which cannot be done by just any observer .
as has been said by the scientists themselves , however , it seems absurd to have one per boat , because as well as emptying our oceanography institutes , there would be no point in having one per boat , as it is much more important to consider planned and organised sampling programmes that are maintained over time , which is what is going to give us a good monitoring overview of these fisheries .
I would therefore be grateful , Commissioner , if you could answer my questions , and I call for support for the report by Mr Freitas .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Laperrouze , for all her work in the negotiations with the Council .
I think what we have is a very good compromise package for water quality standards .
I am particularly pleased that the concept of mixed zones is retained .
on that subject , I have a question for Commissioner Dimas .
from the point of view of feasibility it is an important concept , provided , of course , that it does not significantly damage the environment .
the framework water directive calls for the drinking water purification effort to be reduced .
drinking water standards are strictly than water quality standards .
there are various collection points for drinking water in surface water , and it can happen in practice that the collection points are fairly close to a source of pollution , so that a collection point might be in a mixed zone and the purification effort for water purification companies is increased .
can Commissioner Dimas assure me that he will do everything possible to prevent mixed zones creating problems for drinking water collection points ?
( FR ) Mr President , there is something that is really bothering me .
why did the rapporteur , Mr Weber , decide to deny the European Parliament &apos;s powers by doing his utmost to get us to adopt at first reading a Council common position - moreover one that was basically unacceptable - at a time when we are having difficulty convincing citizens of the value of giving the European Parliament strengthened powers ?
you must explain this decision to me , Mr Weber .
I really hope that tomorrow we will all live up to the expectations of European citizens and show that we are safeguarding the protection of human rights and the values of the European Union .
why ?
I do not think we can accept that unaccompanied minors may be locked up and expelled to countries where they have no family , no ties and no legal representative .
this is an absolute violation of respect , in all circumstances , for the best interests of the child .
nor do I believe we can accept migrants having to suffer the traumatic and destructive conditions of 18 months &apos; detention when they have not committed any crime .
this is an excessive deprivation of liberty , described as such by the case law of the European Court .
nor can we accept migrants being returned at the whim of re @-@ entry agreements to countries where they have no ties and where , Mr Weber and Mr Deprez , we have no means of guaranteeing their physical or psychological safety .
we have no way of guaranteeing the principle of non @-@ refoulement , even if it is writ large in your text .
I therefore call upon all Members to reject tomorrow what is actually only an extension of the repressive , near @-@ sighted policies of the Member States .
Europe needs a different ambition for international immigration .
Mr President , I rise to explain the vote that I made on the Caroline Jackson report , but before doing so I want to pay tribute to my Conservative colleague , Caroline Jackson , and the work she has done on this excellent report .
the provision for waste disposal is absolutely vital in every European country , not least my own , and I think this is a happy compromise .
it is one of those rare instances where Europe can act together in this way .
there are not many of them and maybe the people of Ireland were saying something about that in the decision in the referendum which they recently made .
but this is a good report .
I will hope it will inspire the British Government to take a lead in these matters .
that will certainly be the case if in hopefully two years time in Britain we have a Conservative government : Mr Cameron , our leader , has made it absolutely clear that green issues will be at the forefront of our affairs and therefore this vote today will set a good example , as indeed would be a good example the way Conservative Members of the European Parliament have voted .
Madam President , I agree with the final speaker about the electronic tagging .
it certainly should be voluntary .
I supported Amendment 4 because I want to ask the Commission and the Council to look at introducing some kind of Community financing for the system of electronic tagging .
the goat , sheep and lamb sectors are in crisis and they certainly cannot afford to have further costs foisted upon them .
indeed , I would have preferred Amendment 1 - but of course that fell on the adoption of Amendment 4 - where it was recommended that the implementation of the electronic identification system be deferred until 2012 at the earliest .
I agree with the former speaker , as I said , that the bureaucracy and cost involved far outweigh any of the benefits .
in writing . - ( PT ) As stressed in a press release , we do not support this resolution because :
it does not respond to the immediate problem of workers &apos; wages , failing to clarify that fishermen ( workers ) pay for fuel , and that this is why the problem affects them directly ( as it does the owners of the vast majority of small vessels ) ;
it disregards the EU &apos;s inertia and refusal to take the necessary decisions ;
it does not table any specific proposals in relation to fuel prices ( petrol and diesel ) and as regards fish price formation at the initial point of sale ;
it does not deplore a policy that takes advantage of escalating fuel prices to reduce and concentrate the sector even further , generate more unemployment , ensure the decline of a production sector and worsen the food and trade balances ;
it falls well below positions adopted previously by the EP and proposed by the PCP ;
in accordance with the recent proposals announced by the European Commission , and irrespective of one or two aspects which , if applied , could have positive effects for the sector , at bottom this resolution further encourages the scrapping of vessels and offers fishermen the alternative of giving up their occupation .
because fisheries have a future , we call for measures such as the proposals in the resolution we presented to be adopted as a matter of urgency .
in writing . - ( SK ) Gas emissions from aircraft have doubled since 1990 and are continuing to increase .
if the EU is serious about tackling climate change , it must become the global leader in this area .
we cannot just talk about it ; we also have to adopt legislative measures .
I see the directive aimed at including aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community as a positive step .
the report by the rapporteur , Mr Peter Liese , is a balanced and realistic solution , a compromise between protecting the environment on the one hand , and ensuring the competitiveness of the European aviation industry on the other .
we must not discriminate against European aviation companies , in particular those from the new EU Member States that are trying to catch up with the general trend .
consequently , the rules of healthy economic competition must apply in equal measure to aviation companies from third countries .
it is necessary to conclude an international agreement , and for that reason the EU must negotiate with the US , Russia and China .
we also have to remember that sometimes aviation is the only possible transport mode , linking the EU with remote regions .
it contributes significantly to the development of tourism and therefore must not come to be seen as a luxury .
I believe that the common position of the European Parliament and of the Council will contribute towards clean aircraft and the introduction of new technologies in the aviation industry , and that is why I voted in favour of the report .
( NL ) As chairman of the Delegation for relations with China I agree with the Commissioner when she says that we have strategic ties with the Chinese and that these are important to both of us .
we are aiming of course for economic ties , but more than that .
I think we need to keep emphasising that .
there are two other things I regard as important : individual human rights and freedom of expression .
these are issues which we raise again each time we have contact with the Delegation or members of the Delegation , with our Chinese colleagues .
we disagree , but we discuss them and we try to exchange ideas and arguments .
it is difficult , it is sometimes hard work , but it is something that Parliament must continue to do unceasingly .
have we made progress ?
too little and too slowly perhaps ; but I think we have made progress .
I would urge the European Parliament not to forget that we need to maintain contact with the Chinese and keep on raising these issues , however difficult it is , however tiresome and however frustrating sometimes .
but I think it is the only way forward .
because the fate of the Chinese will be decided not here in this chamber but in China and by the Chinese themselves .
they are the ones we need to convince , not ourselves .
Mr President , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) decided in July 2007 to grant the right to host the 2014 Winter Olympics to Sochi , Russia .
following the Russian aggression against Georgia , United States Congressmen Allyson Schwartz and Bill Shuster made an announcement that , as soon as the US Congress returns from its summer vacation , there will be a US Congress resolution calling on the IOC to designate a new venue for the 2014 Olympic Games .
it is quite clear that , if the Olympic Games were to be held in Sochi , countries would boycott the event , just as in Moscow 1980 following the Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan .
that would strike the Olympic movement much harder than selecting a new host for the 2014 Olympics now .
therefore it is time for the European Parliament to act .
otherwise we might once again be facing the idea of holding the Olympics in an authoritarian and aggressive country that respects neither human rights , civil liberties nor the Olympic Charter .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I will be brief because Bernard Kouchner has already spoken twice and I know that you too have a lot of work to do .
as this debate comes to a close , I should firstly like to thank you for your constant involvement in this matter .
the resolutions adopted , the fact that Chairman Saryusz @-@ Wolski convened the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 20 August and the fact that Mrs Isler Béguin - as she pointed out - went to the conflict region and gave a powerful testimony on behalf of this institution and , beyond that , on behalf of the European Union have confirmed the European Parliament &apos;s involvement in this crisis .
this leads me to say that I have been surprised to hear certain comments about the European Union : firstly , that it has not reacted ; secondly , that it was powerless , and thirdly , that it adopted a position of weakness .
if the European Union was not influential , if it did not play a role in this crisis , then I should like to know who did ?
who was powerful ?
who proved themselves either militarily or in any other way ?
I saw no power other than the European Union taking action and it was during this crisis that the European Union was possibly seen in a new light as a partner and as a power .
everyone has their own responsibilities .
the European Union has its responsibilities which are not the same as those of NATO or the US .
however , through its values and its means - to which I will return - the European Union has fulfilled all its responsibilities .
people say to us : &apos; Russia does not have the same values as the European Union &apos; but , between us , that is old news .
we know that Russia does not have the same values as the European Union .
if it had the same values as the EU , other questions would be asked about Russia .
all the questions asked about Russia concern what type of relations we want to have with this neighbour , what type of partnership we want to build , what type of dialogue we want to have , how we can encourage Russia to fulfil its duties and assume its responsibilities and how can we steer it towards an approach more in line with international law .
these are the questions .
as for myself , I have never believed that we have the same values , whatever respect I may have for Russia , and I have known Russia for some time .
the third thought you have had , and you have all had this thought , is that we cannot go very far , despite a rapid reaction and despite what has been done today , because we do not have the instruments needed , because we will only have these instruments if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and because this crisis has perfectly demonstrated how much we need this Treaty , how much we need to strengthen our foreign policy and how much we need , also , to strengthen our defence policy .
we must be very clear on this and several of you have rightly underlined this .
I now come to the European Council .
today &apos;s European Council forms a starting point .
it did not cover everything and it cannot cover everything in relation to the management of this crisis by the European Union and the relations between the European Union and Russia .
today was about reviewing the situation on the ground and assessing the consequences for relations between the European Union and Russia .
it was about showing that we are united and that we are active in this conflict .
this European Council has enabled us to show that we are united , that we have acted and that we have firm positions .
I would remind you of these : condemnation of Russia &apos;s disproportionate reaction ; support for Georgia in the financial , humanitarian , economic and political spheres ; confirmation of the strengthening of the relationship between the European Union and Georgia ; implementation of the six @-@ point conflict resolution plan including - and several of you have stressed this point - the existence of an international monitoring mechanism ; commitment of the European Union on the ground by sending a Special Representative ; strengthening of the eastern partnership , particularly with regard to the Black Sea area and Ukraine , which was explicitly underlined in today &apos;s conclusions , and an energy policy which is more diverse and independent and better organised at European level .
I have understood everything you have said this evening .
you can be sure that the French Presidency will remind everyone of its wish to have a much more diverse , independent and better structured European energy policy .
you can count on the Presidency in this respect .
this is a starting point because it has been decided that an important journey should be made by the President of the Council of the European Union , the President of the Commission and the High Representative , on 8 September , to Moscow and Tbilisi .
it is in that context that we must assess the subsequent actions that we will need to take .
finally , we have agreed on the fact that all meetings on the partnership agreement should be postponed until the Russians withdraw to their previous positions .
this is therefore a starting point .
our aim today was not to solve everything but to show our unity and our determination and for this we need the support of the European Parliament .
( NL ) Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Svensson .
her report is one of the most patronising , interventionist , politically correct texts of this whole parliamentary term .
she really does seem to be convinced that advertising and marketing are a big conspiracy to contribute , right from the first years of a child &apos;s socialisation , towards the gender discrimination which reinforces the perpetuation of lifelong inequalities between women and men .
I am not making this up : the majority of that sentence was taken verbatim from Recital M of the text .
the report of course advocates more legislation and the establishment of bodies specifically concerned with monitoring compliance with all these new rules .
I would say &apos; jobs for the boys &apos; , if that phrase were not so terribly &apos; gender insensitive &apos; .
paragraph 14 of the text takes the biscuit , advocating the elimination of what it calls &apos; messages conveying gender stereotypes &apos; from textbooks , toys , video games , the Internet and advertising .
censorship , in other words .
I do not know whether the term &apos; textbooks &apos; is also aimed at literature but , if that is the case , we can start straight away by burning works by Shakespeare in the street .
( HU ) Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Flautre on her excellent , balanced report .
I can see three cases where the European Union is applying double standards .
on the one hand , there are double standards when we weigh up two small countries , of which one opposes us and is hostile and the other declares itself to be pro @-@ Western and pro @-@ Europe .
we see double standards between small countries and the bigger powers , Russia and China , because that is when economic interests come into play .
and there is a third double standard , which raises the question of our credibility and whether the European Union has the right to criticise third countries with regard to human rights and minority rights when there are some countries in the Union where several hundreds of thousands of people do not have nationality , like two of the Baltic States , or when there is a leading power in the European Union whose constitution still rejects the recognition of regional languages .
thank you for your attention .
in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues wholeheartedly support human rights for all .
we support the concept of a CFSP EU sanctions regime which is applied on a unanimous basis to target the most egregious abusers of human rights in the world , provided the UK can always exercise a veto in this respect .
we also deplore the way they have been applied inconsistently and are wide open to breaches , such as the way President Mugabe has been allowed into the EU on several occasions in spite of a travel ban on his regime .
unfortunately the Flautre Report goes further by recognising the right of the European Court of Justice to rule over the list of banned terrorist organisations - which must remain a political decision not a judicial one - and claiming the Lisbon Treaty is required to make EU sanctions for abuses of human rights more effective .
it calls for European Parliamentary oversight of the Member State security services and making the code of conduct on arms exports binding .
for those reasons we will not be supporting the report .
( DE ) Mr President , a fellow Member on the left of the House has just used the tragic issue of the death penalty in Iran and the dreadful crimes being committed there as a pretext to launch an assault on religion per se .
he has attributed these actions to the religious nature of the regime .
in my view , that is absurd .
this is a perfectly ordinary totalitarian regime which simply exploits Islam for its own ends .
that is the problem , and we must vigorously condemn the regime itself , not Islam or religion per se .
incidentally , the most heinous regimes in the world &apos;s history were those which invoked National or International Socialism , as China continues to do today .
we should therefore be clear on one point : this House is not the place for ideological disputes , even on the issue of Iran .
it is not about ideology ; it is about the universality of human rights .
this universality of human rights transcends ideological differences .
there are no Asian human rights , and there are no Islamic human rights which give people less security and might condone the death penalty in one form or another .
we are radically opposed to the death penalty , whether it is practised in the US , China , or Iran , but we do not view these countries as the same .
we must be very clear about one thing : the Iranian regime is a totalitarian regime , and we would like to see it come to an end .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , honourable Members , I will just say a couple of things .
first of all , our task is to restore supplies immediately because people are suffering , industry is suffering , people are losing jobs ; so that is the main task , not to create additional obstacles .
but , after that , an analysis should take place , and measures should also be taken .
we should revisit some of our stereotypes , because if 2006 could be called a wake @-@ up call , this is a real shock .
in reality we are underestimating what really happened .
if two countries &apos; governments have accused each other of turning off the tap of the gas pipelines , then the only conclusion that I can draw - because I trust the countries and governments - is that somebody tampered with the pipelines , and that is very difficult to believe .
so what has happened is really extraordinary and I believe it should have a huge impact on the energy policies that we are trying to create .
that is why I believe that no issue should be taboo any more .
we really should discuss how to guarantee security of supply under all possible conditions .
and , to be honest , I never expected full disruption of supply .
it was never in my expectations : it was a shock for me too .
you can blame me as Energy Commissioner , and say &apos; You should have foreseen this &apos; .
but it was never to be expected .
it is something new that never has happened before and we should in future be prepared for such a type of measure .
( BG ) Last Wednesday the European Commission announced its proposal regarding the programme for reconstruction in the field of energy security .
in line with this proposal Bulgaria is to receive only a share of the EUR 20 million earmarked for the project linking Bulgaria with Greece .
only a share of EUR 20 million earmarked from billions for projects !
in my country in these instances we have a saying : &apos; the mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse &apos; .
all this after a big gas crisis !
as you know , Bulgaria was most seriously affected and is the only country completely reliant on Russian gas .
it is officially said that ready @-@ to @-@ go projects are being financed , but suspicions have arisen .
the crucial project that Bulgaria has proposed for the expansion of the Chiren gas storage facility can be finalised within only a few months .
if it lacks support , Bulgaria will take on this project independently , but where does that leave European solidarity and justice ?
again last week an influential European journal wrote that , as a result of this crisis , support in Bulgaria for Eurosceptics will rise to 20 % .
I hope that this is not an accurate calculation .
however , if the Commission continues with such behaviour towards Bulgaria , it will make a decisive contribution towards this .
( LT ) The main lesson of the gas crisis is the great vulnerability of Europe &apos;s energy system and the very significant risk to supply delivery .
this risk remains as the agreement between Ukraine and Russia is a one @-@ time agreement and the situation will undoubtedly be repeated .
bilateral energy questions remain fundamentally unresolved , not just between Russia and Ukraine , but between Ukraine and the European Union and between the European Union and Russia , all the more so because there is no common EU @-@ Ukraine @-@ Russia energy operating system .
there have so far been neither safeguards nor guarantees and these have yet to appear .
I would like to stress that dependence on the supply of gas and on the use of gas is increasing dramatically and will grow even more once the power stations in Lithuania , Bulgaria and Slovakia have been closed .
this shows that the risk remains and is perhaps increasing .
we have a very clear long @-@ term energy strategy for the whole of the European Union .
we have had very heated debates about it .
there is talk of long @-@ term measures .
in my view , the weakest link is our short- to medium @-@ term energy policy .
it has not passed the reality test and this was demonstrated by the gas crisis .
I would invite the Commission to investigate such a scenario which , unfortunately , was not investigated for various other legal and political reasons .
what would be the cost , benefit and consequences of temporarily prolonging nuclear power operations in Bulgaria , Slovakia and Lithuania , thereby fundamentally strengthening the energy security of both these countries and the whole of Europe in this situation ?
in addition , faced with the conditions of a long @-@ term and undefined economic crisis , this would allow resources to be used more efficiently and would greatly reduce the burden of the crisis on our residents and the business sector .
protecting children and young people from sexual abuse is an important issue and , indeed , a problem of our times .
I have always been in favour of prior rights for parents in the upbringing of their children , but in this case the state , too , must protect children and adolescents .
this protection does not apply only to the Internet .
it also applies to media advertising , which should be decent and in keeping with moral values , and should not attack young people &apos;s right to innocence .
parents play a special role in protecting their children against sexual abuse .
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly says , in Article 26.3 , that &apos; parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children &apos; .
the education given by parents includes education on responsible use of the media .
however , parents cannot consistently perform their educational role if they do not have adequate time to devote to their family and their children .
the state should allow parents this free time .
the Internet can never replace time spent in dialogue between parents and children .
a computer game cannot replace talking to one &apos;s grandmother .
the joystick is no equivalent to an hour spent with one &apos;s grandfather in the garage .
the natural family is the space for protection of children , and parents are their first protectors .
this is why I have started a project in Slovakia addressed primarily to parents : &apos; do you know where your child is now ? &apos;
Madam President , Mrs Vassiliou , ladies and gentlemen , the images of the 1999 storm , which was just mentioned and which hit south @-@ west France causing tremendous damage , are still engraved on our collective memory .
it is an understatement to say that Europe was not prepared to endure such a tragedy again , so soon .
there are those who view it as a blow dealt by fate , but I see it rather as a horrendous example of the climate change which you have just referred to , Mrs Vassiliou , for which we merely propose rough solutions whereas in fact urgent action is needed .
this is a situation that we must handle responsibly .
unfortunately , we need to be prepared to face even more natural disasters .
on 24 and 25 January this year , storm Klaus , which hit southern Europe , killed 11 people in France , 14 in Spain and three in Italy .
it caused significant damage , destroying schools and many homes , depriving thousands of people of electricity , heating , drinking water and a telephone service and leaving certain economic sectors in a critical situation , as in the case of the timber industry .
while I am keen to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and all those affected , and my support for local councillors , I would like to take advantage of this forum to call on the European Community since , it has to be said , this kind of situation requires a European response and , first and foremost , European solidarity .
admittedly , in France a state of natural disaster has been declared , which will facilitate aid to disaster victims , but this does nothing to detract from the need to take coordinated European action to supplement the Member States &apos; efforts to protect people , the environment and property in disaster @-@ stricken towns and regions .
in practical terms , this primarily entails centralising information at European level in order to make a precise assessment of the damage .
we must then release the necessary funds to provide support for local authorities that are facing huge challenges .
in particular we should support the public services , which have been doing an exceptional job , and which we desperately need in order to repair infrastructure and equipment in the energy , water @-@ supply , sewage , transport and telecommunications , health and education sectors .
past disasters showed that action at European level is urgent and enabled the prevention of natural risks to be included as one the goals of the European Regional Development Fund .
from now on , Europe must prove its ability to react and to translate its solidarity into practical measures .
I therefore hope , although you have just said so , that the Commission will take this message on board and mobilise all means necessary to respond to this urgent situation , in particular through the EU Solidarity Fund and the Civil Protection Financial Instrument .
lastly , in conclusion , I would like to remind you that , as with the fires in Greece in 2007 , this violent storm has demonstrated the need for a civil protection force that can be mobilised in all crisis areas .
I would like to hear your opinion on this subject , Mrs Vassiliou , as well as your response to Parliament &apos;s request in its resolution of 27 April 2006 , seeking the creation of a European observatory on natural disasters to ensure a more effective European response when these unfortunate events occur .
in writing . - While we all acknowledge and support the role that SMEs play in international trade , it is a real shame that a large part of this report was dedicated to defending so @-@ called Trade Defence Instruments .
in reality , TDIs are being used by inefficient producers as a form of naked protectionism to shelter them from competition , not only from non @-@ EU competitors , but also from more efficient competitors across the EU that have taken advantage of globalisation and established global supply chains .
TDIs punish retailers and consumers who are forced to pay higher prices for goods that they could obtain at better value elsewhere .
they also punish the most efficient and innovative SMEs .
we all know of many SMEs in our constituencies that are punished by the very same TDIs that this report seeks to praise .
it is for this reason that Conservatives reluctantly voted against this report .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the Commission is aware of the Brazilian Justice Minister &apos;s recent decision to grant political asylum to an Italian citizen , Cesare Battisti , condemned in absentia to a life sentence by the Italian judiciary .
we have carefully considered the Commission &apos;s role in this situation , especially after Italy &apos;s European Affairs Minister , Andrea Ronchi , called on Vice @-@ President Barrot last week for the EU to support Italy &apos;s extradition request to the Brazilian Government .
as was also explained to the Italian Government , there is no scope for an involvement of the Commission in this case .
the EU Treaty is very clear on this matter : the European Union &apos;s and Commission &apos;s legal powers in the field of cooperation in criminal matters are restricted to the legal space of the EU @-@ 27 .
the European Union can facilitate extradition between Member States , but has no competences regarding Member States &apos; relations with third countries on criminal cooperation matters .
Italy &apos;s bilateral relations with Brazil on this matter are governed by a bilateral agreement signed in 1989 .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would argue that the Atlantic Alliance is an obsolete defence instrument and that in certain recent cases it has not in fact helped relations , for example , with Russia .
I believe that we should maintain our relations with Russia and use them to pave the way for a privileged partnership .
I agree with Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner &apos;s statement that common security policies should not overlook the fact that in recent times , NATO has not proved to be the most useful instrument of dissuasion or peacemaking .
I believe that Europe now has the maturity and political need to outline its own independent security strategy .
this does not mean adopting an opposite position .
we can be alongside - as other Members have argued - without continuing to be subject to what are often non @-@ European interests .
for this reason , I cannot support the reports put forward .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the last year the number of refugees worldwide has increased .
the figure now stands at approximately 12 million .
if we include those who are internally displaced , this rises to more than 26 million people worldwide who are in need of the same kind of protection .
the reason for this is that wars continue to exist in the world ; at present there are 4 million Iraqi refugees and displaced people , and it is clear that these refugees are a consequence of wars that our countries played a part in starting .
the creation of a common European asylum policy is necessary because , under the rule of law , we have an obligation to guarantee that these people are received equally throughout the European Union .
this becomes all the more important if we consider that some Member States do not yet have a systematic law on asylum .
I note with regret that harmonisation of asylum procedures has been deferred for two years , meaning that it will be implemented in 2012 .
we must put an end to the awful disparity that exists between the Member States and the different asylum systems .
we are at present in a paradoxical situation whereby recognition rates of candidates to refugee status for certain third country nationals vary from approximately 0 % up to 90 % depending on which Member State receives the request .
harmonisation of standards should result in a high level of protection throughout the EU and should not be based on the lowest common denominator .
the institution of asylum is an essential part of our democracy and the protection of human rights , and it is unacceptable that it has been severely eroded in recent years , as the needs of asylum seekers and the principle of non @-@ refoulement laid down in international conventions have not always been respected .
the European Union should provide for mechanisms at the external borders to identify asylum seekers and ensure that persons entitled to international protection gain access to its territory , including in the context of its external border control operations .
for this reason we consider it appropriate to review the role of Frontex , which often handles asylum seekers as if they were illegal immigrants .
with this report , the European Parliament is asking Frontex to provide detailed data relating to the number of asylum seekers identified as such during its operations and the plight of persons intercepted and sent back to a country of transit or origin .
we must ensure that international conventions are correctly applied , as well as cooperation agreements with third countries .
agreements cannot be made with countries that have not signed the Geneva Convention .
many Member States ignore this , however , including Italy , which has signed an agreement on managing migration flows with Libya , a country that does not intend to sign the Geneva Convention on refugees .
we are very pleased - we have emphasised this and hope that it comes across in this report - that the Court of Justice has annulled the article of the Asylum Procedure Directive concerning the creation of the concept of &apos; safe third countries &apos; and a common list of safe third countries .
in our view , there can be no such thing as a &apos; safe third country &apos; ; it is an erroneous concept , since any citizen can be persecuted even in countries with high democratic standards .
asylum seekers are vulnerable people who require appropriate reception conditions .
Member States cannot detain people for the sole reason that they are applying for international protection .
I would therefore argue , as a matter of principle , that asylum seekers should not be detained .
unfortunately in many Member States the detention of asylum seekers is still a reality , due to the fact that they enter the country illegally .
regrettably , and I will conclude with this point , there is no other way to enter the European Union .
this is the paradox : even asylum seekers must be subject to mixed flows to enter the EU .
asylum is not a concession : asylum is a duty for states and a right for those fleeing war .
Mr President , Mr Vondra , thank you for the Czech Presidency &apos;s commitment to this issue .
your support has been much appreciated .
I should first of all like to reply to Mr Marinescu by saying that there is no particular problem , given that the Member States that are not yet members of Schengen will be able to join in the SIS II system too .
we shall have several &apos; slots &apos; , or times , when new Member States that are not Schengen members will be able to join in SIS II , and so , all being well , there should not be any particular problems .
Mrs Grabowska , I must thank you also for all that the Republic of Poland is doing to guard the external borders .
I have had the opportunity to observe , in fact , the quality of the work carried out by Frontex with the Polish teams on the Ukrainian border .
I should simply like to say , in response to Mrs Roure and Mrs Grabowska , that the problem is basically a technical one .
it is not , as Mr Vondra said , a political problem .
the truth is , quite simply , that the Member States , or some Member States , have made greater and greater demands .
therefore , it has to be said , SIS II has had to meet increasingly sophisticated objectives .
consequently , the system has become more complex and , despite all the tributes you have paid to information technology , the implementation has turned out to be more difficult than expected .
nonetheless , it is true that the problem remains essentially a technical one and that it should therefore be able to be resolved .
I should like to say to Mr Pirker that Parliament will be kept well informed , and I hereby undertake to do this .
I have personally taken this on during the course of this project , and I think I can say that I truly consider it to be an absolute priority .
I wish also to reassure Mr Brejc that we have clearly identified those in charge .
working with the Commission , we have set up this Task Force , in which the Member States are closely involved .
I think that we now have a definite steering group , but our co @-@ contractor also has to be able to meet the requirements we have set .
I should also like to reply to the financial question posed by Mr Pirker and Mr Posselt just now .
the Commission &apos;s total budget commitment for the SIS II project amounts to about EUR 68 million .
the corresponding contracts include feasibility studies , development of the actual central system , support and quality control , the s @-@ TESTA network , preparation for operational management in Strasbourg , security , preparations in relation to biometric matters , and communication .
that , then , is the commitment : EUR 68 million .
as far as payments are concerned , EUR 27 million have actually been spent to date on technical development : EUR 20 million on developing the system ;
it has to be said that if , after gaining a clear idea of the reliability or lack of reliability of SIS II , the Council decided to move over to the SIS I + R formula , we could at that point consider reusing the communication network put in place for SIS II , meaning that the corresponding investments could , for the most part , be preserved .
our real problem , ladies and gentlemen , is equipping Schengen , the Schengen area of free movement , with a genuinely effective tool .
it is true that , if we succeed with Schengen II , it will be the most effective system in the world , given the results it will enable us to achieve .
the information technology , however , has to be in place .
anyway , what I should like to say to you , after the Czech Presidency - and once again I am grateful to Mr Vondra for the Czech Presidency &apos;s commitment to this difficult issue - is that I truly believe that , together with the current Presidency , we have made every effort to avoid any further delay and to genuinely enable our co @-@ contractor to meet our expectations .
in any case , we shall have a definite date fixed to enable the Council to take the necessary decisions . once again , I do , of course , undertake to keep Parliament informed .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - As the honourable Member has pointed out , improvement of road safety and reducing the high number of fatal accidents on Community roads are among the priorities of the Czech Presidency for the transport sector .
this is not surprising , as we are the country located right at the centre of the continent .
traffic intensity and the related dangers are a top priority for us .
sharing the same concerns as you and with a view to improving the current situation in the short term , the Presidency intended to hold a ministerial debate at a Council meeting in spring 2009 on future development in the area of road safety in the context of the preparation of a new action plan on road safety .
however , in view of the fact that the Commission has indicated to the Presidency its intention to postpone the date of the adoption of this new action plan , the Czech Presidency considers this debate to be premature .
one example of concrete action under our Presidency in the field of road safety is a final negotiation between the Council and the Parliament on a proposal for a regulation concerning type @-@ approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles .
as you know , the Presidency and Parliament &apos;s representatives managed to reach an agreement concerning this proposal and the European Parliament adopted the regulation yesterday .
the general safety regulation requires the mandatory fitting of electronic stability control systems on all vehicles , and an advanced emergency braking system and a lane @-@ departure warning system on heavy duty vehicles .
these new technologies can significantly improve vehicle safety and it is clear that road safety will benefit when they are introduced as the standard system on new vehicles .
agreement at first reading will allow the obligatory introduction of electronic stability systems in new vehicles from 2011 , one year earlier than foreseen in the original Commission proposal .
furthermore , the Council has just started the examination of the Commission &apos;s action plan for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems ( ITS ) in Europe and the associated proposal for a directive laying down the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport .
both items have as one of their goals the improvement of road safety through the application of information and communication technologies to the road transport sector .
the Presidency intends to invite the Ministers to adopt the Council conclusions on the action plan at the Council meeting in March 2009 and a general approach or a political agreement on the abovementioned proposal at the Council meeting in June 2009 .
the role of the ITS in the area of road safety will also be discussed during the informal meeting of transport ministers to take place in late April in Litoměřice in my country .
intelligent Transport Systems and applications such as emergency call and driver hyper @-@ vigilance systems , speed alerts and alcohol locks could make a considerable contribution to enhancing our road safety .
electronic stability systems and eCall alone could save up to 6 500 lives a year in Europe if they are fully deployed .
given the importance the Presidency attaches to road safety , it will examine any other proposals on these issues that the Commission may present shortly , provided the limited time available until the end of June allows it .
author . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Africa is the only continent that has not made any progress to speak of when it comes to meeting the Millennium Goals , particularly in the area of health , that is , in mother and infant mortality , the fight against HIV / AIDS , TBC and malaria .
this is wholly attributable to their weak healthcare systems and the human resources crisis that is sweeping that sector .
it is therefore abundantly clear that investing in health systems is essential in the fight against poverty .
this is , moreover , also the Commission &apos;s view , but according to the report by the Court of Auditors , even though the Commission has claimed this for years , it has done precious little in the way of making any practical changes .
the Commission is making efforts , mainly via vertical funds in the fight against AIDS , and this may well be necessary in our view , but this should not be at the expense of the overall package of investments in basic healthcare .
Commissioner , the budget for basic healthcare has not increased even proportionately since 2000 in the framework of the whole package of official development aid .
there is therefore enough reason for this Parliament , on the basis of the Court of Auditors &apos; report , to ask the Commission a few questions and make a few recommendations .
I would like to make four points .
firstly , the budget for healthcare must be increased .
clearly , a joint initiative is what is needed here from the EU along with its partner countries .
the developing countries have committed to investing 15 % of their budgets in the framework of the Abuja Declaration .
this cannot possibly be done , though , Commissioner , if the Commission and Europe are only prepared to spend 5.5 % of the European Development Fund ( EDF ) on this .
I should therefore like to find out from you in what way the Commission would like to ensure that in the framework of the 10th EDF , the investments in health will be increased .
secondly , better and efficient use should be made of budgetary support .
even though this is one of the Commission &apos;s showpieces , it receives low scores in the Court of Auditors &apos; report .
nonetheless , budgetary support very much has the potential of meeting the shortcomings in southern healthcare systems .
whilst sectoral budgetary support can really target health systems , it is hardly used in sub @-@ Saharan Africa .
general budgetary support can also prove helpful , provided the Commission can commit , and kindle enthusiasm in , the partners to select healthcare as a central sector , and we would urge the Commission to do this .
my question to the Commission is : in what way will you ensure that much better and much more targeted action is taken both via sectoral support and general budgetary support ?
Millennium Development Goals ( MDG ) contracts are one of the Commission &apos;s promising instruments .
I am 100 % behind them , but in all honesty , they are somewhat too insubstantial and too short @-@ sighted because they are only meant for the good students , and so alternatives are very much needed for the others .
thirdly , expertise must be enhanced .
according to the report , the Commission has too little expertise to put its policy proposals in the healthcare sector into practice .
this is why we would ask the Commission to guarantee this expertise by drafting in more health experts and also by working more effectively with the WHO and the Member States .
fourthly , the healthcare sector must be better coordinated .
Commissioner , it is absolutely vital for the European Code of Conduct on Division of Labour to be put into practice , and that the investments in , and programmes on , healthcare between the different EU countries are better coordinated .
in addition , we must ensure that the so @-@ called orphans among the needy countries can also guarantee aid in the area of health .
I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to Mr Staes who , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , supports the concern expressed by the Committee on Development , and has asked the Commission to clarify its plans with a view to the discharge procedure , and preferably before the end of 2009 .
it is clear , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , that this Parliament urges the Commission finally to translate its policy priorities into reality with more conviction and with better instruments .
this is more than necessary if we want to be in with a chance of achieving the Millennium Goals by 2015 , because , Commissioner , basic healthcare deserves sustainable investments in the long term .
I voted in favour of the report drafted by my colleague , Marian @-@ Jean Marinescu , aimed at improving the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system .
thanks to the Single European Sky initiative , the single aviation market has grown and evolved over recent years .
however , very little progress has been noted in the overall efficiency of the design and use of the European route structure and , consequently , airspace users and passengers are paying unnecessary costs .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s proposals aimed at setting binding performance targets for air navigation service providers , a European network management function to ensure convergence between national networks and clear deadlines for Member States to improve performance .
I congratulate Marian @-@ Jean Marinescu on drafting this report .
I welcome the rapporteur &apos;s proposals on developing an initiative for a full system approach in the field of safety in order to keep air transport safe and sustainable .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s initiative which considers full transparency of charges .
the established costs should be consistent with the convergence criteria based on the performance improvement scheme .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , when the European Union is , at times , seen as over @-@ keen on regulation and quite rightly criticised for this , this can be traced back , quite simply , to reports such as the one we are now discussing .
as much as I support realistic measures to combat any form of discrimination , I must also criticise the points being discussed here , because they are simply not justified and will not have the desired effect .
it is unacceptable that , as has already been mentioned , faith schools , for example , can be sued for rejecting teachers of a different faith , or no faith , or that insurance companies can be sued for undertaking a risk assessment if it results in a distinction on the basis of age or sex , or that there is a risk of absolutely all residential buildings having to be constructed to be barrier free .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , that is the direction we are heading in ; we will no longer actually be supporting disabled people , but making all housing unaffordable .
housing that nobody can afford , instead of assistance for disabled people - surely that cannot be what we are aiming for here .
then there is the criticism of the reversal of the burden of proof .
if I think that , as an MEP with 25 applicants for an assistant &apos;s position , I could have a case brought against me just for the appearance of discrimination or a feeling of discrimination , I will simply not be able to work any more , but spend all my time battling with the evidence I need to provide just because the feeling is there , even though I have not discriminated in any way .
on top of that , there is the vagueness of many of the terms .
overall , this factsheet that has been published is a precursor to this directive , which starts to discuss whether we are still allowed to use &apos; Miss &apos; and &apos; Mrs &apos; , or whether we need to get rid of all words ending in &apos; man &apos; , such as statesman or sportsman , because it could all be discriminatory .
ladies and gentlemen , some of what is being called for here is quite simply nonsense , and I will therefore be voting against the report .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :

on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a terrible tragedy in my country has hit the important central region of the Abruzzo and the city of Aquila .
it has been a disaster that has affected human lives , including young lives ; it has struck houses , our homes ; churches , our places of worship ; monuments , our culture ; companies , our workplaces ; universities , our centres of learning ; and has left great devastation in its wake .
we have all rallied round these people and we can now say this : firstly , that they have responded with great dignity , despite being so intimately and so practically affected , losing their most valuable possessions such as their homes - and , as we know , the home is central to Italian culture - yet these people have reacted with dignity and want to start living again , rebuilding what they had , their own communities , within the places that represent that community and in keeping with tradition and continuity .
I am reminded of the importance of the university and of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises for that region , which is at present suffering from severe economic hardship and lack of recovery .
I should also say that there has been an extraordinary mobilisation on the part of the institutions : the government , Parliament , all the opposition forces , as well as the majority who , with great wisdom and responsibility , regard the work to be done in a spirit of unanimity : local institutions , volunteers , civil protection , the thousands upon thousands of young people and adults who went to Abruzzo and who represent social groups , associations and the Catholic community ; everyone has made a contribution .
even those who did not travel there have done something : economically , culturally , our country &apos;s entire cultural , social and economic spheres are being mobilised , which is very important .
it will , however , be important to remember this , as Mr Pitella said , when it comes to reconstruction , because in addition to these positive aspects of the tragedy , the structural weakness of our building methods has come to light , and I believe that here , alongside calls for justice , there should be a commitment to identifying liabilities and to reconstruction .
a word about Europe , Mr President : when disaster struck , Europe was there , as it will be in the future through the funds and other actions that have been mentioned .
I would wish for there to be a visible presence , too , so that Europe is recognised not only in the money that arrives , but also in the faces and in the institutions .
I propose that a joint delegation from this Parliament visit the region , without pomp , without publicity , but in order to say that Europe is made up of institutions and people , and that these institutions and people want to support and go on supporting Aquila , the Abruzzo and my country , also , which has been so severely damaged .
Mr President , the directive we are dealing with today must above all be seen as a complement to the cooperation that has been in existence for three decades between the Member States and their social security systems .
today , in my country , Luxembourg , more than 30 % of healthcare is already provided outside its borders and , moreover , the case of Mr Bowis , to whom I wish a full recovery , is a perfect example of the correct use of the existing regulation , as he was admitted to hospital in Brussels as an emergency case .
he has been well cared for and , for a British citizen , there is no problem about reimbursements .
what , therefore , does this directive need to improve ?
it must firstly improve the information given to citizens : information on the services offered , information on the centres of excellence which Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt has explained so well and , above all , information on the quality of care .
I believe that many member countries , including my own , have to make progress on quality criteria and on quality of care information .
in addition , of course , if I am abroad and things go wrong , I need to have a place that I can turn to .
all that is well regulated in the current text , but we think there are three things that have to improve .
firstly , we believe that a system of prior authorisation for hospital care has a twin advantage : firstly , it is a big advantage for European citizens because they will know exactly when they will be reimbursed and the care will be also pre @-@ financed .
moreover , this allows the planning of major hospital infrastructures , since a good health system will not be created by the invisible hand of the market .
it has to be planned .
the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance &apos;s second demand concerns a twin legal basis , because we do not want healthcare to be considered as a market .
it must be very clear that the system is organised , above all by the Member States .
the third point relates to rare diseases : we want specific legislation because this is too important , and we would be deluding Europe &apos;s citizens if we were to say &apos; go and look somewhere in Europe , and it will be taken care of &apos; .
we want specific legislation .
thus we do not want a Bolkenstein II , we want a text that gives legal certainty and that serves the majority of Europe &apos;s citizens .
author . - Mr President , gender responsiveness is a measure of good governance anywhere in the world , but even more so in Afghanistan after the suffering endured by women for decades there .
there cannot be true peace and recovery in Afghanistan without priority being given to respecting the human rights of women .
this Shia family law allows marital rape , approves child marriage and bans wives from stepping outside their homes without their husbands &apos; permission .
women &apos;s human rights and dignity cannot fall victim to pre @-@ electoral negotiations with Islamic fundamentalists .
the international community present in Afghanistan must put much more pressure on President Karzai and the Afghan authorities to come up with proper laws which respect the human rights of women , and policies that are committed to enacting those rights and respect their dignity .
like the Shia family law , the delaying of the Afghan media law , which was passed by the Afghan Parliament months ago by two thirds of the Parliament , is a tool by President Karzai to continue control of the state media , vital propaganda ahead of the presidential elections .
the international community cannot allow this to go on .
this law is fundamental to ensure that there is freedom of expression and of the media in Afghanistan .
without that , anything that we are doing in Afghanistan is not worth it .
it is crucial that action is taken on these two laws and that the international community makes sure that the authorities in Afghanistan abide by their commitments , by their words , in terms of human rights , and respect in particular the rights of women .
( NL ) Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Estrela warmly on her splendid work .
Parliament &apos;s proposal to extend maternity leave to 20 weeks on full pay , six of them after the birth , has by no means been plucked out of the air .
many countries already provide for more than 18 weeks for mothers , on 80 @-@ 100 % of their pay .
therefore , I fail to understand why my fellow Members from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats wish to reduce Europe &apos;s ambitions to a meagre 16 weeks .
I would say to those who consider the cost too high that women must not lose out on account of becoming mothers .
it is often the case nowadays that women have to resort to other forms of parental leave , but not all women have a right to these .
in addition , these are much lower paid , and thus are not feasible for women who are less well @-@ off .
ladies and gentlemen , it is also important to us that paternity leave and co @-@ maternity leave be regulated here , as this directive also concerns equal treatment between women and men .
fair sharing of childcare responsibilities means that fathers , too , must be granted leave upon the birth of their child .
to be frank , ladies and gentlemen , two weeks is a very modest start , but one that is important in those countries where fathers are yet to be given any place in a young family .
ladies and gentlemen , the social partners failed to reach an agreement on paternity leave or adoption leave , and so we , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , consider it our duty to regulate the area in this directive for the benefit of fathers and adoptive parents .
I am sure that the majority in this House will support us in this .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - Madam President , it is a necessary evil of our times that , unfortunately , human and animal health research requires , as a must , animal experimentation .
it is my firm belief that no true scientist enjoys experimenting on animals or does so when alternative means of research are available .
such research must of course at all times be as humane as possible to the animals involved .
to this end the directive under debate seeks - correctly , in my view - to improve matters significantly and decidedly .
important areas of note are the safeguarding of the principles of ethical review and authorisation as well as the concepts of enhanced national inspections and increased transparency throughout .
it must be emphasised that the aim of the scientific and political world should always be to phase out the use of animals in research if and when alternative and effective methods not using animals are made available .
I will be brief , as I realise there is very little time .
Commissioner , I have to say that the implementation of the rights we have are , frankly , a joke at the moment .
I was recently in Amsterdam and watched KLM dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check @-@ in .
the staff systematically , without asking the passengers , declined the compensation and assistance which they were entitled to .
can we have some monitoring by the Commission ?
can we have some people actually at airports looking at what the airlines do ?
because , frankly , it seems to me that it has become a joke .
( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Sweden has always respected human rights and democracy .
some time ago the Swedish people voted against the euro , and you have respected that decision , although you yourself were strongly in favour .
that is why it is rather odd that Ireland should now promptly have to vote once again on exactly the same treaty .
it is the Nordic and the Swedish way to respect the voice of the people .
I wish you luck and success in the challenge that you now face .
I hope that you will respect the values of the best sort of Nordic democracy : not through compulsion but through cooperation .
I am very pleased that you mentioned the Baltic Sea , and I fully support you in this matter .
the Baltic Sea is in difficulties ; it is dying and it needs to be saved .
the Northern Dimension has been missing in all this , however , and I hope that you will do a lot to promote it , although you made no mention of it .
we must say straightaway that preventing natural disasters and adapting to climate change is not an easy task .
even if the European Union fares somewhat better than other regions of the world with the creation of a strengthened civil protection mechanism and the financial godsend represented by the Solidarity Fund , more than 600 000 hectares are destroyed each year .
I am not just talking about the forest fires in the Mediterranean Basin , the worst of which were those of summer 2009 in the uplands around Athens .
for me , two proposals seem essential to improve the situation .
firstly , Mr Barnier &apos;s report of 2006 on a European civil protection force must be implemented in full .
we are still waiting for the European green helmets to be set up to give substance to a European policy for civil protection voted for by citizens .
secondly , it is important for the Commission to have a right to oversee what is happening locally .
it would be surprising to say the least if European grants were paid when some forest fires were probably started by criminals with the sole aim of preparing the land for development .
( it ) Madam President , it is strange that , when we talk in this House about freedom of expression in Italy , we continually exceed the speaking time , and thus indirectly censor the next speaker .
I shall therefore try to keep strictly to the speaking time allocated to me .
I have to say that I would consider it far more appropriate to hold this debate in the Italian Parliament than in the Parliament of Brussels , unless - as someone has already stated - it were our intention to debate freedom of the press in general , that is , within the context of the European continent .
leaving opinions aside , however , I believe that it is worth mentioning some data already presented previously by Mr Speroni and on which we should reflect .
I can confirm that , of 455 sentences handed down by the European Court of Human Rights for infringement of Article 10 on freedom of expression , 29 relate to France , 28 to the United Kingdom , 15 to Greece , 10 to Romania , 8 to Poland and only 7 to Italy .
I would ask you to reflect on this data .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , in my remarks , I shall touch upon the forthcoming EU @-@ US Summit that will be an important milestone in our transatlantic partnership , as well as addressing certain EU @-@ US aspects , particularly on climate change negotiations under way and also some critical GLS issues .
the change in the US Administration in January has had a very significant impact on EU @-@ US relations , and our partnership has got off to a good start .
I would say we have re @-@ energised our relations and I am convinced that the Lisbon Treaty , once in force , will also contribute towards the further strengthening of this vital relationship by providing the European Union with an even stronger foreign policy identity .
that is also what our friends in Washington expect .
but let us be also clear .
our aspiration for a true partnership of equals with the United States also means that Europeans must be willing and able to deliver .
I would say that it is a dual momentum , internal and external , that makes the summit in Washington so important .
the first formal summit with President Obama took place after our informal meeting in Prague this spring .
now the preparations for the Washington Summit are in full swing .
we are working with the US side on delivering tangible results in priority areas .
the global economy and climate change are likely to be the two major areas of focus of the summit discussion , in addition to a number of key foreign policy challenges .
on the economy , the focus in Washington will be on joint efforts to combat the economic and financial crisis and securing a sustainable global economic recovery to secure jobs and create growth .
we will move further on governance issues for the global economy , notably on financial regulation and a timely follow @-@ up to the G20 Pittsburgh Summit .
the Commission will also emphasise our joint interest in countering protectionist tendencies and we will call on the US to renew efforts to bring the Doha Round to a successful end .
secondly , on climate change , we as the European Union will encourage the US to go to the Copenhagen conference with ambitious objectives to reach a sound global agreement , and we will also engage with the US to make progress on establishing a cap @-@ and @-@ trade system across the Atlantic .
thirdly , on foreign policy , we will , of course , also discuss with the US how to meet urgent foreign policy challenges .
here we will focus on how to cooperate further and more closely on the Middle East peace process , on the challenges posed by the nuclear ambitions of Iran , and on ways in which we can assure the renewal of the compact in Afghanistan , which is at the basis of our concerted efforts there .
I will have a separate foreign policy meeting with Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Bildt to discuss these matters in greater detail .
furthermore , I expect the summit also to adopt a declaration on non @-@ proliferation and disarmament , taking forward EU @-@ US cooperation in many of the areas identified by President Obama in his speeches in Prague and New York .
this initiative , which carries strategic importance in itself , is indicative of the renewed US commitment towards effective multilateralism , which the European Union has every intention of supporting and consolidating .
last but not least , a further major summit outcome will be the creation of a new EU @-@ US Energy Council which will have its first meeting on 4 November .
on the EU side , the Council will be chaired by myself , my colleagues , Commissioners Piebalgs and Potočnik , and the Presidency , and on the US side by Secretary Clinton and Secretary Chu .
the Council will look at global energy security , energy markets and product regulation , at new technologies and research .
in short , it will provide added value in a policy field , the importance of which is obvious .
now there is also a new Transatlantic Economic Council ( TEC ) .
that will be complementary to the Energy Council , which we will re @-@ energise as well .
the TEC meets in Washington next Tuesday - so before the Energy Council - and its outcome will obviously feed into the summit talks as well .
a promising area in our transatlantic cooperation is what we call upstream cooperation .
we will discuss policy approaches early on , so that we will avoid divergent regulation down the road .
it goes without saying that we need such cooperation more than ever .
the needed coherent response to the financial crisis is the best example for it .
we will also explore whether we can intensify this forum of cooperation for nanomaterial health care @-@ related information .
upon a US initiative , we also intend to launch closer cooperation in the area of innovation .
both sides recognise that enhancing the innovative potential of our industries and our workforces is essential for the creation of jobs and growth and therefore for a successful emergence of the coming crisis .
and the Commission , of course , will also repeat our European concerns on some critical issues such as securing trade , potential distortions of competition from State aid and procurement policy in the US .
finally , we as the Commission have also , from the very beginning , strongly relied on the European Parliament &apos;s support for the TEC process , and we are grateful for this .
so rest assured that we will very much support the initiatives by the European Parliament &apos;s delegations for relations with the USA to strengthen parliamentary involvement in TEC matters on both sides of the Atlantic .
we would like to consolidate the TEC &apos;s role as a bilateral forum to address both day @-@ to @-@ day and strategic issues regarding transatlantic trade and investment .
and importantly , the TEC will have reached out to the transatlantic legislators &apos; dialogue and civil society stakeholders , too , so clearly we need the expertise and political thrust of legislators to tap the full potential of the transatlantic market place .
my colleague has already mentioned that GLS will also be very important .
there will be a Troika meeting on GLS affairs on 27 and 28 October in Washington , in the framework of our cooperation on justice , freedom and security .
Vice @-@ President Barrot will represent the Commission .
we are in the final stages of preparing a statement that will aim to renew our transatlantic partnership in these areas .
in the Washington meeting , there will be the opportunity formally to exchange the instruments of ratification of the extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements so that they can enter into force in early 2010 .
these agreements will strengthen our efforts in fighting crime in today &apos;s globalised world .
on another critical matter close to the hearts of the citizens , we certainly need to make further progress , as was mentioned .
we will reiterate the call for visa @-@ free travel to the US for all EU citizens ; we will express our concern over the prospect of a fee for the electronic system for travel authorisation as the de facto new tourist tax ; and we will once again remind the US of the need to lift the restrictions on travellers with HIV / AIDS under the US visa waiver programme , as you have mentioned .
finally , a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs will be travelling to Washington around the time of the ministerial meeting , so we trust they will also be able to convey the same messages .
Vice @-@ President Barrot is also ready to meet the Committee on Civil Liberties delegation while in Washington .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , I have the opportunity to convey my approval to the rapporteur .
the report has an extremely important role even if it only refutes the widespread myth - a myth spread by the Russian Federation - that Georgia started the war .
at the same time , this report is balanced , and criticises both sides in the conflict , even saying that they could not prevent the conflict .
the report is certainly significant because it very clearly states the fact that the Russian Federation - right from the start of the conflict - organised training on South Ossetian territory , and provided the South Ossetians with military technology and also other military equipment .
another essential moment in this report is definitely the question of &apos; passportisation &apos; , which the Russian Federation has been implementing for many years , both in Abkhazia and in South Ossetia , and thus creating a conflict with international law , not to speak of the undermining of good neighbourly relations .
though the report says very clearly that this passportisation has not made the people living in South Ossetia or Abkhazia into citizens of the Russian Federation , only de jure are they still Georgian citizens and also because of this , the Russian Federation &apos;s claim that they were protecting or sending people to protect their citizens in South Ossetia definitely does not hold water .
another important part of the report is certainly the fact that it speaks of the ethnic cleansing on South Ossetian territory in the Georgian villages .
this is a very important moment .
unfortunately , however , the report does not deal with the ethnic cleansing which the Russian Federation carried out in Abkhazia from 1991 when , because of Georgia &apos;s independence , almost a quarter of a million Georgians were forced to leave Abkhazia , their own country .
also , finally , Madam President , I would like to say that the most important thing of all is , of course , the reference in the report to the fact that Georgia &apos;s independence , autonomy , sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected .
for us , the question today is can this really be done , and if we now , before long , are celebrating 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall , then I would like to ask , ladies and gentlemen , when will we be able to celebrate the day when Abkhazia and South Ossetia are united with Georgia ?
( DE ) Mr President , democracy needs a revolution , and it is never wrong , Mr Dartmouth , to speak out in favour of transparency , Mr Verhofstadt .
you in particular , in the Swedish Presidency , could be a shining example of this and actually tell us what is going on in the horse trading for the top posts that is completely unworthy of the European Project and also - Mr Barroso could lead the way on this - with regard to the appointment of the commissioners .
Germany and Austria are a poor example in this regard , but so , unfortunately , are others .
there are qualified people sitting in this Chamber , but they have no chance of being accepted .
please , now that the Treaty of Lisbon has been adopted , be courageous and honest and admit that we need much clearer , transparent decision @-@ making structures for the Commission and for the top posts .
with so much expertise , it has to be possible to find good people in the European Parliament rather than gathering them from some province or other .
Madam President , it is good that there is a regular summit between the EU and Russia , as there is , of course , a lot to discuss .
key topics on the comprehensive agenda include the planned cooperation agreement , securing the supply of energy , Russia &apos;s accession to the WTO , climate change , the situation in the Caucasus and , above all , the situation with regard to democracy and the rule of law in Russia .
disarmament , arms control and a possible anti @-@ missile shield are also on the agenda .
we also both face threats in the form of international terrorism and fundamentalism .
a country like Iran is a challenge for both the EU and Russia .
both of us belong to the Middle East Quartet and , together with the US , are obliged to work towards a solution in this region .
we hope that the conditions will soon be in place for visa @-@ free travel between the EU and Russia .
I am sure that unhindered interpersonal contact is the best way to give young Russians , in particular , a real picture of the life and ideas of Europeans and our intentions towards Russia .
the prerequisite that will enable us to get through this agenda is , in my opinion , agreement within the EU and clarity in our message towards the outside world .
although it is a cliché , all too often we have experienced divisions amongst ourselves , or we have allowed ourselves to be divided , over nuances .
in this regard , no EU government should believe that it can negotiate better in the long term alone on an equal footing with Russia than we can achieve through the combined weight of the EU .
as a community of values , we have a common view of the situation with regard to the rule of law and human rights in Russia and we should say so .
unfortunately , we had to award the Sakharov Prize to a Russian organisation .
my thanks to the Presidency for its clarity in this regard .
as we are equally dependent on energy supplies , we need to ensure that the agreements in the three @-@ way relationship between Russia , Ukraine and the EU are formulated in such a way as to prevent a drop in gas pressure in parts of the EU every winter .
in the Caucasus , we must jointly demand unrestricted access for EU observers .
as regards disarmament or the anti @-@ missile shield , the EU must make its position clear to Russia and the US .
if we achieve all of this , then Russia will take us seriously and we will co @-@ exist well .
Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President , Ministers , ladies and gentlemen , I have been here in the European Parliament for 5 years now , and I work in the field of internal affairs and the law .
today , therefore , is a day of joy for me , when we have the opportunity to debate the programmes for the next five years , when we will be able to deliberate on this future as a European Parliament on an equal legislative footing .
we are discussing a dossier , a subject area , that exercises the public , where the public expect answers from us , where they even say that this is an area where we need more Europe .
that is not so for every subject area , but in this case it is .
they are making demands of us .
they want answers from us .
I therefore want to very briefly describe the change that will result from the new working basis and these subjects .
the first point is working with the Council . we always have representatives of the Council here and they always tell us , as Presidents @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , that Parliament is very important and that we must work together .
when they leave that role , however , that understanding often crumbles away .
it will be our job , as parliamentarians , to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away , or for it - as with the SWIFT agreement , for example - to create precedents , despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process .
that cannot , and in future , will not , be the situation any longer .
it was a bad example of the institutions taking each other seriously .
my second point is that we must be creators of ideas .
the new treaty gives us the opportunity to table legislative initiatives .
if we want to strengthen Frontex , we cannot just call for things to happen and just make proposals , we must also put legislation on the table .
in future , we will have the opportunity to do that .
my third point is that we also need to be a serious partner , one that does not just draw up wish lists . if , for example , we are dealing with the fight against illegal migration , we must not just take on NGO positions , we must be a serious partner .
finally , the European Parliament must take subsidiarity seriously .
if we have competence , we must also consider which subject areas would be better dealt with at the national or regional level .
these are four subjects that I think are important for the forthcoming few years .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) would have liked the proposals for the Stockholm Programme to have been much more ambitious still , but today is a day to rejoice that we are entering this new phase , and all that remains to be said is let us get on with the work !
in writing . - I welcome Parliament &apos;s commitment to this cause .
in particular , it is critical to ensure that the women in some of the most vulnerable circumstances , such as in &apos; trafficking of women &apos; , fall under this assistance .
I am appalled that the ECR Group , which contains the British Conservatives , has submitted an amendment to this proposal which reduces its coverage .
I would point out that many victims are those who live in poverty or are immigrants or from minority groups within our populations .
removing these women from assistance aimed at helping these most vulnerable people is as illogical as it is inhuman .
I am equally appalled that the Greens should disagree and promote deletion of sensible wording covering tolerance of prostitution , where it is clear much violence against women occurs .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it would be very important for 2010 , the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion , to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument , dedicated to microfinance , aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro @-@ enterprise plans .
as we are aware , micro @-@ credit has proved to be an extraordinary tool for creating self @-@ entrepreneurship opportunities and widespread social value in developing countries , particularly for women .
it has become a new strategy of the United Nations and of the World Bank , but it has also been trialled with positive results in many countries , in many European Member States , including Italy , particularly for immigrants , women and young people .
by adopting this report , Parliament is providing , in the midst of a serious economic and financial crisis , not only a strategic opportunity for social inclusion but also a positive challenge to the banking system , since it is developing a new approach and new powers , in collaboration with non @-@ profit bodies and local and national institutions .
I welcome the adoption of many amendments , which I will not go over again , but I would like to say that today we are asking not just for micro @-@ credit resources , but we are also asking that micro @-@ credit ...
( the President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , the Swedish Presidency has spent a considerable amount of time getting the Treaty of Lisbon in place .
we are extremely proud of the fact that it has now entered into force .
it contains significant improvements , which will be good for the European Union and for European citizens .
one of the most important changes that the Treaty of Lisbon brings is precisely the introduction of the power of codecision for the European Parliament in the area of justice , security and freedom .
this will give the European Parliament the power of codecision in a lot of areas .
that is a good thing and it will increase the quality of the legislation that we produce together .
it will also increase legal certainty and that is very important , as these are sensitive and difficult areas .
I would also like to thank you for your support with regard to the introduction of sanctions against terrorists , individuals or regimes that oppress people and deny them their human rights .
sanctions and respect for human rights and legal certainty are not mutually exclusive - quite the contrary .
sanctions can be very effective and legitimate if , at the same time , they have legal certainty .
I can assure you that the European Parliament will be involved in the formulation of new rules , including those relating to terrorism , with the power of codecision under Article 75 when it comes to sanctions within the European Union .
however , as regards external action , in other words sanctions against third countries adopted by the UN , the European Parliament will have no power of codecision .
this is what both we and the Commission clearly understand the treaty to state .
however , we will give a lot of attention to your resolution on this matter and will always bear in mind the human rights aspect when we resort to the instrument of sanctions , within the EU and in the UN .
we are continually trying to improve the procedure .
we note your request for consultation and the exchange of information regarding proposals for sanction systems .
I believe we can work together effectively and I have no doubt that we will find suitable ways to cooperate within the current institutional framework .
having listened to the speeches , I would like to say how pleased I am to see that many MEPs , from very different groups , agree over the need to harmonise procedural guarantees at European level and to draw up a genuine European law on procedural guarantees .
all the speakers and all the Parliamentary groups agree on the need to draw up a genuine European law on procedural guarantees .
this illustrates the importance and need for the European integration process and the importance of a citizens &apos; Europe , of a European judicial area and of implementing the Lisbon Treaty .
this subject is the focus of the Spanish Presidency &apos;s programme for the next six months and has received indubitable support in all the speeches I have heard , based on a variety of arguments and seen from different perspectives : the need to move towards harmonised procedural guarantees .
I would also like to take up the point raised by Mrs Flašíková Beňová , which I believe is very important , on the need to take this step specifically at the time when the European Union is about to sign the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I wish to end , Mr President , by stating that the Council and the Spanish Presidency will work to ensure that all these procedural guarantees are put into practice , through the directives that the European Commission will table in due course and also the directive that is already in progress , based on an initiative by 13 Member States , as far as I remember .
I would like to make one final point about the European Arrest Warrant .
the European Arrest Warrant has been brought up only to criticise it .
I wish to say that the European Arrest Warrant is a fundamental example of European Union and of cooperation against organised crime in the European Union .
I am entitled to shout this from the rooftops , coming as I do from a country like Spain , which still suffers from terrorism and for which the European Arrest Warrant is an essential weapon in the struggle against terrorism .
Madam President , the development report on Turkey drafted by the European Commission in 2009 identifies the implementation of constitutional reform as an important challenge in continuing the democratisation process .
the report notes that , in spite of the people &apos;s clear support for the government and the large parliamentary majority , the advances made up to this point in implementing political and constitutional reform have not been sufficient , because the parties have not been able to find a common language .
as in any other democratic country , the positions taken by the Turkish parties reflect the wishes of the electorate .
it must not be forgotten that in a democratic society , the parties are , above all , accountable to their electorate , and in Turkey , the European Union must turn its attention to developments at grassroot level .
we must be very cautious in merely taking a didactic approach in guiding Turkey &apos;s democratisation process .
the successful implementation of the desired reforms requires the support of the public , for which a greater universal level of awareness is necessary , as well as a conception of the importance of and the reasons for the reforms .
the top @-@ down reforms that have been implemented will not lead to the desired result as long as there exists a feeling that they present a danger to Turkey &apos;s internal stability .
the pressure on Turkey &apos;s government to accelerate reforms for which there is a lack of public support could , though unintentionally , lead to the flourishing of separatism or religious hostility .
I hope that the Council and the Commission , together with the Turkish Government , make efforts towards implementing measures which allow the population of Turkey to be involved in the democratisation process considerably more than has been the case so far , in order to ensure that there is fertile ground for implementing the reforms necessary for accession on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria .
with the Resolution on Croatia , which Parliament is to adopt here today , we will recognise that this country has made progress in terms of fulfilling the criteria for accession to the European Union , carrying out democratic system reforms and harmonising its legislation with the requirements of the acquis .
that places Croatia firmly at the top of the list of countries with the prospect of becoming fully @-@ fledged members of the European Union .
that also opens up the possibility for Croatia to wrap up negotiations as early as this year , as we have stated in our report .
we are very pleased to note that Mrs Kosor , the new Croatian Prime Minister , has quickly and successfully taken steps in the areas where we have met the greatest obstacles so far : in the fight against corruption and organised crime , in implementing a programme of administrative reform , in addressing war crimes and in ensuring legal or constitutional protection for ethnic and other minorities .
by signing a border arbitration agreement with its neighbour Slovenia , the new Croatian Government has not only eliminated an obstacle to the negotiating process , but has also paved the way for the resolution of other issues .
it is important that Croatia continues to address border disputes with its other neighbours and ensures that these negotiations are conducted in good faith and according to the principle of pacta sunt servanda .
I should also point out that this resolution , which was drafted under the excellent guidance of my fellow member and rapporteur , Hannes Swoboda , has , in an objective and positive way , also highlighted problem areas where Croatia still has a great deal of work to do .
to name but a few , these include cooperation with the Hague Tribunal , efforts made so far in prosecuting corruption , restructuring the economy and finances and greater commitment and sincerity in eliminating the obstacles to the return of Croatia &apos;s Serbian population .
Croatia is their homeland , too .
the positive reports on the progress of Croatia and FYROM should also be seen as a definite signal of the EU &apos;s openness to enlargement to all the countries in the Western Balkans and a confirmation of the commitments we have undertaken towards these countries , Turkey included , provided they meet all relevant criteria .
that , however , depends primarily on them .
let me conclude by wishing Mr Füle , our new commissioner , every success .
I know he will do an excellent job .
Madam President , Commissioner , five years ago , this Chamber went through the Orange Revolution , too , in a certain sense .
however , several weeks ago , including in Mrs Ashton &apos;s speech , questions were asked about whether the Ukrainians were ready for the Orange Revolution , and if they had put it all into practice ?
I share Mrs Harms &apos; regret , here , that Mrs Ashton is not with us today .
there is an answer to this question : a 70 % turnout at an election is , truly , a rarity in Europe , and it is a real rarity in our countries , too .
in this sense , Mr Brok is not right when he says the Orange Revolution lost .
it won , because it was all about having rules from which everyone could benefit .
in Poland , too , we know about situations in which the beneficiary of democratic rules was someone who had formerly been opposed to democracy .
however , this is good - this is how it should be .
now the time has come for our answer : have we done everything we should have done following the Orange Revolution ?
have we answered that question ?
apart from all the instruments which the Commissioner has spoken about - and it is good that we have created these instruments - have we answered that the door is open for Ukraine ?
can far @-@ reaching reforms be carried out in a post @-@ communist country without that promise ?
can we encourage people to make sacrifices if we tell them they will always be kept waiting outside ?
should we not , rather , tell them : there is room for you in Europe , not today , not tomorrow , but there is room .
to say that is a great opportunity for the new Commissioner , Mr Füle .
Mrs Ashton has not come , today .
Commissioner , be bold and be the first person who starts to say that there is room .
not today , not tomorrow , but there will be room .
this will be of great help to the Ukrainians .
this may be the last moment when this can be said , and this is why all Ukrainians must be certain that integration , cooperation with Europe and changes to the law are their own personal opportunity .
this must not just be said to the elite , to businesspeople or to students .
it must be said in such a way that everyone will understand that it is still worth making sacrifices after the years of communism , that it is still worth doing something .
it is an opportunity for you , too , Mr Füle .
say this clearly , and you will go down in history .
you will help not only Ukraine , but all of Central Europe , because prosperity and security for Ukraine mean an opportunity for the whole of Central Europe .
everyone must feel that they have an opportunity .
this is why , apart from the association agreement , which is very important , we need to relax the visa requirement for Ukrainians and , in the future , lift it .
we need to say very clearly : the door to Europe is open for Ukraine .
someone must , at last , after these five years , say it .
( it ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , President of the Council , you may not be well known , as Mr Farage maintains , but I know that your ideals are deeply rooted in European tradition and culture , and for that I admire and respect you .
precisely for that reason , may I take the liberty of commenting on your very rational speech by drawing an analogy from the world of football .
the vision that you have of your role seems to me to be similar to that of a halfback , of a midfielder who has the job of bringing order to the game for a team which , after the rule changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon , may find it harder to score goals , that is , to achieve its objectives .
in the light of this example , I believe that it is up to Parliament to risk more than the other players , to be a striker who continually reinvents the game , taking inspiration from the new rules so as to strengthen the team &apos;s attacking ability and to put our hypothetical centre forward - the Barroso Commission - in a position to score .
what will happen if we do not follow this approach , which I wholeheartedly support ?
we will withdraw into a defensive position and we will score an own goal against the interests of our fellow citizens .
precisely for this reason , Mr Van Rompuy , I ask you to support the new leading role played by Parliament and to see it not as an obstacle , but as an opportunity .
we are all required to rise to this historic occasion , to perform a historic role , a historic task , and I am certain that you are the right man to lead us .
thank you , Mr President , for giving me the opportunity to speak on this item regarding the situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus .
the European Union is certainly very concerned about the deterioration of the situation in Belarus , especially with regard to human rights .
the lack of freedom of expression and assembly , the constantly increasing pressure on the media , the laws restricting the use of the Internet and the actions against opposition activists are causing the human rights situation in Belarus to deteriorate and worsen .
in her statement on 16 February , last month , Mrs Ashton , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , also expressed her concern regarding the situation of the Polish minority in Belarus , and regarding the detention by the police of some members of that minority .
this statement , this formal position of the High Representative , was also sent to the authorities in Belarus through official diplomatic channels .
on Monday , we were able to discuss this matter in the Foreign Affairs Council , and we were able to have a thorough debate that I am sure will be repeated in future .
there was , incidentally , a speech made by the Polish Minister , who expressed his concern and his feeling that there was a need to react and to take a position regarding the systematic harassment of members of the Polish minority .
it must also be said that the different facets of the European Union are , without a shadow of a doubt , very concerned , and are monitoring this situation very directly and very closely .
I think it is very important to convey to the authorities in Belarus that they must comply with the commitments that they have made in the OSCE to respect human rights and to protect minorities as an essential part of respecting human rights .
in the Foreign Affairs Council that I referred to , there was an express request made to the European Ministers to draw the attention of the authorities in Belarus to this situation through the appropriate channels and in the appropriate forums .
I think that it is in the common interest of Belarus , the European Union and all Europeans that we manage to have an influence in stopping these actions , which are contrary to human rights and to the rights of minorities , that are very considerable and significant in Belarus .
at the same time , I think that it is important for Belarus to be working in the right direction , and all of the dimensions of the Eastern Partnership are an opportunity to influence Belarus in the right direction , including the multilateral aspect .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to report something to Parliament and ask for its support .
I want to report that in the south of the Union , in the industrious and enterprising city of Valencia , there is an historic marine quarter called Cabañal , which could be destroyed by a plan that the council wants to implement after abandoning the area for almost 20 years .
the local residents have protested against this plan .
at the request of the Supreme Court , the Ministry of Culture has ruled that the plan will amount to a desecration of heritage , and the Constitutional Court also recently tried to stop it or ruled that it should be stopped .
the response of the public authorities has been to refuse to submit to the institutions , with the resulting risk , danger and lack of political concern .
the plea for support that I am making is for the local residents to receive the help that they ask for from Parliament regarding this desecration of heritage , to ensure that such a major , barbaric aberration cannot take place in a district such as Cabañal in the south of the European Union .
this is the second occasion in the last two weeks that I have spoken about Gilad Shalit in plenary , and I am pleased that the joint efforts made with my fellow Members have resulted in this resolution .
&apos;The case of Gilad Shalit &apos; demonstrates the particular concern the European Union has for the humanitarian situation in Gaza .
Gilad &apos;s rights , which are set out in the Geneva Convention , should not be made conditional upon the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict .
indeed , Gilad Shalit &apos;s father Noam has repeatedly confirmed that neither he nor his family is involved in politics .
they have not chosen to be in this situation at the moment .
the ideal scenario for us Europeans would be two states coexisting in peace and security .
negotiations for Gilad &apos;s release have been going on right since 2006 via different intermediaries , with , in actual fact , one highly controversial proposal being put forward for him to be handed over in exchange for 1 000 Palestinian prisoners .
Gilad and his family need our help .
thank you very much .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Trichet , I would like to thank you very much , not only for what you have done in recent years , but also for your approach in recent weeks .
you have been competent , independent and consistent . you and your staff have been a calming influence in troubled times .
Mr Rehn , you have made some very encouraging statements over the last few days .
we should do everything possible to continue on the path that you have taken .
the euro is a stabilising force , even in times of crisis .
we must put an end to the myth that the euro and the Stability and Growth Pact are the cause of the problems experienced by Greece and other countries .
last week , the Greek Prime Minister said very clearly in this House that the euro is not to blame . on the contrary , it is part of the solution .
there can be no reform without the euro .
there can be no appropriate restrictions on the objectives that we can set ourselves without the euro .
we must not make the euro weaker , if those countries which are affected feel that the euro protects rather than weakens them .
I would also like to add that Greece is not begging for money , which is the impression often given by the daily press .
it would be a good thing if many members of the Council stopped focusing on popular opinion on the domestic political front when they talk about this subject but instead worked with us to find common European solutions .
Greece cannot be given subsidies , but it wants support for implementing its reform and savings plan .
the President of the European Central Bank , Mr Trichet , has also stated very clearly in a three @-@ step plan what is possible and when the measures can be taken .
no one has said that nothing could be done .
we have a monetary union , but we do not have an economic union .
to achieve an economic union , we need the political will of the Member States rather than advice .
the economic union includes the coordination of budgetary policy , the harmonisation of taxes and the coordination of education , economic and social policy .
this is what we are calling on the Member States to do and we expect them to show commitment .
we must continue on this route in the interests of the euro .
I voted in favour of this report on the priorities for Budget 2011 .
as stated in the report , specific support must be provided for entrepreneurship and for micro @-@ enterprises , and these issues should be placed at the heart of European Union policy for youth and innovation .
the report demands that help be provided to all the programmes and instruments which encourage entrepreneurship - particularly in rural areas - as well as providing help during the start @-@ up phase of new businesses and encouraging information exchange among young entrepreneurs .
support should be given to programmes that help young people who are starting a new business .
I welcome the emphasis this report places on youth policy and on the role young people have to play as we attempt to escape from the current economic and financial crisis .
I strongly support the demand in the report for increased investment in young people and in education , as was recommended in the &apos; EU strategy for Youth &apos; .
the role and the importance of young people in the European Union and in the future of the Union must be recognised , encouraged and supported .
( RO ) Europe &apos;s maritime matters cannot be viewed separately from international maritime matters .
Europe is a major competitor on the maritime transport market , especially in terms of transporting passengers and containers .
the European Union &apos;s position in the global market in this sector must be enhanced .
improving the quality of training given to sailors , as well as their working and living conditions , both on board and when in port and roadsteads , can go a long way to meeting this requirement .
there is a shortage of highly qualified workers right across the European maritime sector , from shipbuilders right down to pleasure boats .
companies in the US , Asia and the Middle East offer far more facilities than their European counterparts .
in these conditions , European professionals in this sector prefer to be employed by maritime companies or shipowners in Dubai or China , while European ships are crewed by Filipino and Indian seafarers .
this situation must be ended .
maritime institutions in Member States must work together much more closely in order to harmonise their training programmes , as well as offer opportunities for paid work placements and exchanges of experience with European maritime companies .
I also wish to raise another point relating to security , which is extremely important and continues to hamper the smooth flow of global maritime traffic .
I am referring to the situation in the Horn of Africa . I welcome the actions of the NAVFOR Atalanta operation , which is completely fulfilling its duty in the region .
however , we must recognise that specific investment is required in the defence industry in order to be able to supply the military with ships and other intervention resources which are much more effective than those which the European navy currently deploys .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about , so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment .
I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team .
I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved - the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency - for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations , as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted - well , sometimes anyway .
so , what did we achieve ?
the aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent high @-@ quality decision making for those in need of protection , and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need .
it is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States .
differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not .
and those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection .
there is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others , that their need for support is not given a real practical response .
under the refugee fund , there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments , but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach .
the Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure .
specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation .
the key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office , how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States , and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office .
the issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links .
we have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate , offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account .
the Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee - I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that , but still - and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks .
the role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group , and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that - partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office .
as regards solidarity between the Member States , Parliament wanted binding mechanisms , Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation , and the final language is more neutral , but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to , which will cover the Support Office &apos;s impact on practical cooperation on asylum .
on the role of the consultative forum , there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States , and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable .
we know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs , and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities , which often deliver much of what is required under the common system , also had an opportunity to be included .
so we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body .
in conclusion , we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system .
we hope it will be of high quality - even if we could not quite get that into the final text - and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support .
I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions , elected authorities and civil society can contribute , because , while this is about cooperation between Member States , it is not entirely intergovernmental .
it is a European institution we are creating .
( ES ) Mr President , last week Europe missed a great opportunity : the opportunity to be the world leader in astrophysical research for the next twenty years .
the European Southern Observatory decided , on the basis of reports which were far from transparent , that the European Very Large telescope would be located in Chile and not in the Canaries .
this is a time to congratulate Chile , but also to reflect on whether in Europe everything possible was done to have a European installation , decided on by a European institution , with European funding involving an investment of more than EUR 1 billion , located in Europe rather than in the Americas .
the European Parliament was unanimous in its support for locating it in La Palma and I am grateful for that , but what did the Council do ?
what did the Spanish Presidency do ?
did it hold any meetings with the Observatory ?
did it hold any meetings with any of those Member States responsible for deciding on the location of the telescope ?
did it really support the European bid ?
Europeans from La Palma , the Canaries and the rest of Europe are waiting for answers on this .
at the moment they are left with the conviction that not everything was done that could have been done .
- Mr President , I welcome the fact that the total amount of irregularities in the way European funds are being used is declining .
the fact that the amount of irregularities in the agricultural sector fell so dramatically by 34 % is especially encouraging .
a strong and competitive role for OLAF is among the factors that helped to improve the situation .
I welcome the proposal enshrined in our resolution to increase cooperation among EU Member States in the area of taxation .
however , I want to express my deep concern about the fact that fraudulent activities increased in the new Member States , especially Romania and Bulgaria .
in EU @-@ 10 they grew by 8 % while debt for the EU @-@ 2 increased by 152 % .
I want to express my strong support for the calls on Romania and Bulgaria to build up their administrative capacity to manage EU funding and improve the supervision and transparency of public procurement procedures at all levels .
today , we voted on the motion for a resolution drafted by my Slovenian colleague Mr Peterle , of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , on the fight against cancer .
of course , I endorsed adoption of the motion of the European Commission to set up a European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009 @-@ 2013 .
this new form of cooperation is intended to support the efforts of Member States in the fight against cancer .
medical statistics show that over 3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths are recorded every year in Europe .
this means that every year cancer holds second place among the most serious diseases and causes of death .
as part of the European Partnership , Member States should prepare , as quickly as possible , integrated plans for fighting this cruel disease , so that it will be possible to reduce incidence by 15 % by 2020 .
however , it must not be forgotten that in this uneven fight the most important factor is prevention .
this is the most cost @-@ effective measure , because one third of cancer cases can be avoided .
therefore , preventative measures should be supported both as part of medical practice and in the context of ever more healthy lifestyles .
( ES ) Madam President , as the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , I was the co @-@ author of the resolution adopted on the Stockholm Programme in November , along with Mr Casini and Mr Berlinguer .
I would like to point out that I said at the time that the Stockholm Programme was not going to make Parliament &apos;s life easier in the area of freedom , security and justice but , on the contrary , it was going to make it much harder .
I want to say here that some of the requirements in the resolution that was adopted have not been reflected by being clearly set out in the action plan proposed by the Commission .
therefore , as I am aware of the limitations of parliamentary debate and parliamentary intervention in the debate on the action plan , I do wish to point out that paragraphs 148 to 150 of the parliamentary resolution contained some precise indications regarding extremely important issues .
many of these have been stated , from victim protection to the institutions and agencies related to Schengen , Europol , Eurojust , Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office and its pending new regulations , but there were also some regulations on substantial and fundamental problems , such as data protection and the clause to combat discrimination .
the interdependence of data protection and security has certainly been debated in Parliament , in particular , during the debate on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme ( TFTP ) , and the debate highlighted the need for Europe to make its own commitment to an appropriate balance between security and privacy .
what is really important , however , is that the Commission now has five years of work ahead of it to implement each of the links in the action plan for the Stockholm Programme step by step .
I therefore call on it to really work very hard with Parliament to take into account all of the commitments relating to paragraphs 148 and 150 of the resolution , keeping in mind that if the Commission does not work diligently and closely with Parliament , it will be vigilant and it will make proposals .
it will , of course , also work with the Council , which can adopt initiatives that might deserve to be considered and dealt with by Parliament .
( EL ) The Lisbon Strategy set high targets , but Europe did not manage to implement them .
we are moving towards a new strategy for the next decade , to be true , and in an exceptionally difficult and unfortunate environment .
we all agree that the priority and the emphasis on the development triangle &apos; education , research , innovation &apos; is the best investment if we are to get out of the crisis and it allows us to be optimistic about the future of Europe .
it is important to emphasise that this strategy must be implemented in an environment of solidarity , in an environment of close cooperation between the Member States .
at this point , I would clarify , for the avoidance of all misunderstanding , that the support mechanism for Greece , despite any delays , demonstrates this solidarity and you should be in no doubt as to the fact that we recognise it .
in the New Democracy , in our centre @-@ right party in Greece , we made it clear that we respect the money of the other European peoples being put into the support mechanism .
however , together with the sacrifices required , and which must be divided fairly , and on this point we were critical of certain measures , together with the spending cuts required in order to reduce the debt and to reduce the deficit , growth initiatives which will take the country out of recession are also needed , initiatives which we have not seen to date .
that is the only way we , too , in Greece shall be able to approach the ambitious targets of the 2020 strategy , which is the only way we shall come out of the crisis stronger .
( the speaker agreed to reply IN due course to a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
Member of the Commission . - I want to thank Mrs Kratsa @-@ Tsagaropoulou for a very pertinent question - or rather a set of questions - because the image and credibility of the euro is an issue of major concern for all of us Europeans at this critical juncture and these difficult times .
the euro is not only a monetary arrangement ; it is also a core political project - if not the core political project - of the European Union .
therefore , the fate of the euro , the image of the euro , the credibility of the euro has major implications for the overall European project .
I have here a carefully calibrated draft answer of four pages which I asked my services to prepare .
I am tempted to read it out , but it would take some 12 minutes of your time .
however , I am ready to make this available and I can also put it on my website .
this is not only a matter of media actions and campaigns - no matter how important they are - it is also a matter of policies and concrete actions in order to defend the euro from the systemic attacks it has been under recently .
I would just say in passing that we are carrying out regular quantitative surveys .
we have regular flash Eurobarometer surveys which we conduct in all Member States - we have done it in different waves .
we are using every opportunity to actively communicate the latest developments and policy actions taken in respect of the euro and economic and monetary union .
the concerns of the general public are addressed through all available channels , such as the website , publications , questions and answers , leaflets as well as various networks dealing with economic policy making , trade unions , employers &apos; organisations and so on and so forth .
we are working on all fronts together with the Member States in order to get the message across concerning the euro .
as regards the policies which are at the heart of the matter , and this deals with part &apos; b &apos; of Mrs Kratsa @-@ Tsagaropoulou &apos;s question : what measures are being envisaged to improve the image of the common currency and its credibility in the eyes of the public ?
I want to make three points on this .
first , we have decided on a very substantial financial backstop called the European financial stability mechanism and facility - almost EUR 500 billion - which , together with the rescue package for Greece on coordinated and conditional financial assistance , has helped to stop the bush fire of financial uncertainty before it has turned into a forest fire all over Europe .
we are taking concrete steps in order to safeguard financial stability and the euro in Europe .
secondly , our Member States are making great efforts in fiscal consolidation .
in fact , there is a wave of fiscal consolidation and structural reform going on in Europe in order to restore and reinforce confidence and credibility in the euro and economic and monetary union .
we are not doing it without careful calibration ; we are doing it in a coordinated and differentiated manner so that those countries with no or little fiscal space , such as Greece , Spain and Portugal , have to accelerate fiscal consolidation .
while many other countries still have fiscal space , they should not start consolidation before next year - this is to ensure that we do not suffocate the current ongoing economic recovery .
just today , we presented a total of 15 excessive deficit procedures , and on the basis of our assessment , our Member States &apos; strategies of fiscal consolidation are in line with this coordinated and differentiated fiscal exit strategy .
finally , reinforcing economic governance is absolutely essential in order to reinforce the credibility of the euro and I do indeed count on your support when you vote on the resolution on Europe 2020 and on reinforcing economic governance .
we need your support in order to convince the European Council - convince the Member States - and keep up the momentum so that we can have these more rigorous systems of budgetary and economic surveillance and policy coordination in place by the beginning of next year .
author . - ( FI ) Madam President , human rights violations in Zimbabwe have been discussed before by this Parliament .
unfortunately , once again we are forced to address them .
this time it is the case of the human rights activist Farai Maguwu .
he is simply a prisoner of conscience .
he has been arrested and imprisoned for standing up for the human rights of others and then providing the media with information on human rights in the country .
the European Parliament is appealing for his release and for all human rights violations in Zimbabwe to be investigated and , obviously , ended .
this case is especially blatant and , being so , particularly unpleasant , in that someone who stands up for the human rights of others himself has to suffer .
( PL ) Madam President , the experience we have gained from the events of recent months , and our concerns over the complicated situation in the fuel market which is a consequence of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , should drive us to take effective and emphatic steps to protect the environment and , above all , to prevent similar disasters in the future .
all efforts should be geared to increasing the safety of crude oil extraction .
the experts are trying to persuade us that the right preventive measures mean the oil companies have relatively few accidents - yes , this is true .
however , the facts that procedures are being ignored and savings are being sought at the cost of safety mean that catastrophes similar to the one in the Gulf of Mexico might happen in the future in Europe , too .
worldwide , there are currently around 1 600 drilling platforms in operation , and this number is constantly increasing .
new , ever larger and more powerful oil wells and drilling platforms continue to be opened .
extraction is reaching into deeper parts of sea basins in areas which are ever further offshore .
therefore , the significance of classical oil wells is falling , while that of drilling platforms is growing .
debate on the safety of extraction is inevitable , and a comparison of theoretical safety standards with those which are actually being applied may prove surprising .
it is essential to subject oil firms to additional restrictions and to introduce new regulations which can improve safety .
I know that some countries have already begun inspection of drilling platforms on their own initiative .
the first inspections have already revealed certain breaches of safety norms .
it has turned out that many platforms in the North Sea have been operating in breach of basic safety principles .
I think preventive action should be taken immediately to subject drilling platforms and all sites where natural resources are extracted from the sea bed to suitable regulations and oversight .
it is essential to introduce new safety standards and principles which will have to be followed by all parties which are involved in and jointly responsible for the extraction of crude oil .
the possession of valid certification is a key requirement .
Madam President , Mr Karas , ladies and gentlemen , just a few days after the agreement reached in the Basel Committee , I think that it is very important that Parliament is demonstrating its commitment to banking reform and clearly showing that Europe behaves and must behave in a way appropriate to its global standing .
I would like to thank Mr Karas and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their commitment and for this excellent report .
Mr Karas , you raise a number of critical points which will be studied very carefully before the adoption of our proposal for revision of the Capital Requirements Directive next spring .
I first want to say that I share your view , Mr Karas , on the importance of problems which are specifically European - our banking economy in Europe does not resemble those of the other regions of the world in all areas - the necessity , Mr Karas , of an in @-@ depth impact assessment and the need to maintain a level playing field at international level .
we must , of course , stress that increased capitalisation of the banks is a necessary precondition for making the financial sector more stable and strong , but it will not be enough .
as you know , ladies and gentlemen , since you are working on it , we must also have stricter supervision , stronger corporate governance , supervision of speculative financial activities and a framework for crisis management and for resolving banking crises .
that is our road map .
thanks to you in particular , much progress has already been made in this direction .
I am thinking of the supervision agreement and the Green Paper on the governance of financial institutions .
the Commission , for its part , is doing its job , and it will do it in such a way that by the end of next spring , we will have submitted to you and to the Council all the texts that are expected of us for implementing the recommendations of the G20 .
it is in this spirit that , a few days ago , I presented the draft regulations on derivatives and on short selling .
in a few days , we will put forward a new document on the bank resolution and crisis management tools .
returning to today &apos;s debate , however , I would like to discuss three issues , with regard to which I share Mr Karas &apos;s concerns .
the first is the recognition of capital instruments issued by cooperative banks , or mutuals , under the definition &apos; tier one capital &apos; .
the agreement reached in Basel will allow us to take account of the specific circumstances of these unlisted banks , which play an essential role in financing European businesses .
my services are now working with experts from the Member States on defining the technical arrangements for properly implementing these new principles in European legislation .
second , as regards the rules on liquidity and the definition of &apos; liquidity buffer &apos; , the Commission is fully aware of the problem raised in particular for Denmark and Austria .
indeed , the very serious concerns expressed by the Commission in this context are the very reason why an agreement has not yet been reached on this issue .
we had some reservations , and my services will continue to work with our partners in Basel to find a solution , particularly as regards the recognition of covered bonds .
the third point concerns the leverage ratio .
we cannot go back on our commitments made at the G20 on this point .
we are , however , satisfied with the agreement reached in Basel , which makes the leverage ratio part of Pillar 2 during a reporting period , as Mr Karas said a moment ago , the aim being to transfer it under Pillar 1 .
this transfer will not be automatic , and we will integrate a revision clause on this subject into our draft proposal for CRD 4 .
I would now like to say a few words on the implementation of the Basel Agreement in the European Union .
this financial crisis has shaken the world .
it has taught us some lessons , which we must take on board .
the global prudential rules were not suited to real @-@ life conditions .
in addition to the reforms which have already been implemented in order to strengthen the existing rules , we now have the agreement recently drawn up in Basel by the group of governors of the central banks and those responsible for banking supervision .
in my view , this agreement is good news .
it is an important step in strengthening the rules and global financial stability , and this new Basel Agreement will help to establish common rules for the banking sector internationally , which is extremely important .
this agreement also paves the way for a balanced solution : businesses benefit from an adaptation period providing sufficient time to meet these new requirements , which will allow for the health of the banking system to be gradually improved without , we think , compromising economic growth .
ladies and gentlemen , my services , my colleagues - whom I want to thank - have done a great deal of work in Basel to find common ground with our non @-@ European partners .
I hope that the Heads of State or Government of the G20 will approve this new Basel Agreement during the forthcoming Seoul Summit in November .
however , we will not stop there .
the next step will be to reform the basis of the banking system at Union level .
we always take the specific circumstances of our Union into account when implementing international rules , and , ladies and gentlemen , the CRD 4 Directive will be no exception ; here , too , we will take the specific circumstances of the European Union into account .
furthermore , in this context , we will specifically carry out the macro @-@ economic and micro @-@ economic analysis which forms part of this Basel Agreement , and you and your colleagues will naturally be informed about it , Mr Karas .
our aim is to adopt the proposal for a directive during the first quarter of 2011 .
this means that the Member States need to transpose it before 1 January 2013 .
that will give them enough time to conform to these new provisions .
we must nevertheless remain realistic .
this agreement reached in Basel constitutes very significant progress , but I repeat : there is still much to be done .
we will work together with you and with the Member States in the coming months to implement one of the essential reforms of the post @-@ crisis period .
I would like to be very clear on this point too : we will be very attentive and very vigilant when it comes to ensuring that our main global partners - above all , the Americans , but not only them - also implement this essential reform correctly and in due time .
this is an issue which I shall raise during my second and very imminent visit to the United States , at the end of this month .
finally , I agree with you , Mr Karas , that it is essential for the European Parliament to play an even greater role in this process .
that is why , in conclusion , I pledge to keep you - your committee and the plenary session - regularly informed of all future developments within this Basel Committee .
Mr President , we are having this debate today on women &apos;s working conditions because women and men experience different conditions on the labour market .
women are trailing a long way behind men when it comes to wages , pensions , top jobs and executive positions .
more than ever , therefore , we need the EU to take initiatives that improve the position of women on the labour market so that we can bring Europe into line with the treaty .
we must ensure that women - whether they are from Portugal or Poland , Belgium or Bulgaria - are guaranteed equality on the labour market .
a major and important step towards complete equality is a new and modern piece of EU legislation on maternity leave .
there are many good reasons for us to have new legislation on maternity leave in Europe .
first and foremost , there is a risk that , before long , the EU will face a demographic crisis - a crisis that could be at least as serious as the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves .
women in the EU are quite simply not having enough children .
if we are to retain our competitiveness in the future and create growth , which is necessary in order to maintain our level of prosperity , more children need to be born in the EU .
we therefore need a maternity leave law that motivates families to have children .
a common high standard for maternity leave is essential in order to create an effective internal market .
an internal market should not only be about cheap goods - it is just as important to ensure high social standards for workers .
we must not have disparate competitive conditions , where it could be advantageous to lower the conditions for women , who will then become victims of social dumping .
fathers must also have the right to two weeks &apos; paternity leave on full pay .
if we are to create equality between men and women , we need to understand that men also play an important role in connection with paternity leave .
this will have a beneficial effect on equality , the children and , not least , the fathers themselves .
we hear from the lobbyists for professional associations that this is a crazy thing to do and that we cannot afford better maternity leave legislation .
I would venture to claim that quite the opposite is true .
we cannot afford not to ensure that we have new , modern maternity leave legislation .
it is a question of the health and safety of the EU &apos;s women and children .
thus , this is not something that we should gamble with .
we must increase the participation of women on the labour market throughout the EU .
the objective of the EU 2020 strategy is to get 75 % of all women on to the labour market .
as we know that currently , only 60 % of women work , this will be a major challenge .
we must succeed , however , and there is no doubt that good facilities for childcare are the way forward .
a second and equally important initiative , however , is full pay during maternity leave .
only by preventing discrimination against women can we get more women on to the labour market .
another important step towards more equality on the labour market is the report on precarious women workers , for which I was rapporteur .
unfortunately , the situation is such that women are significantly over @-@ represented when it comes to these jobs .
women employed in private homes , in particular , have very precarious working conditions , characterised , among other things , by little or no job security , no social security , a high risk of discrimination and a poor working environment .
we must not allow women to work under such poor conditions .
the EU should therefore support the Member States to enable the precarious jobs to be replaced by proper jobs with decent working conditions .
for a long time , we have neglected to focus on these vulnerable women , and it is my hope that the Commission will take this report seriously and help to take care of some of the EU &apos;s most vulnerable citizens .
passed with a large majority , the revised framework agreement signals indisputable progress in relations between the European Parliament and the Commission .
it is indeed time for the institutional balance put in place by the Treaty of Lisbon to be rigorously reflected .
among the key elements of this revision , we especially need to welcome the equality of treatment between Parliament and the Council , particularly when exchanging information and accessing meetings .
in this respect , I can only be glad about the provisions introduced concerning the negotiation of international agreements .
how could Parliament give its approval in full knowledge of the facts if it is not informed throughout the negotiation procedure ?
MEPs are well and truly determined to implement fully the increased powers at their disposal since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force : evidence of this was the rejection in February of the Swift agreement .
one thing is certain ; we will have to remain vigilant in order to maintain this new institutional process .
( ES ) Mr President , exactly eight years ago this November , the Prestige , an oil tanker carrying 70 000 tonnes of crude oil , suffered an accident off the coast of Galicia causing a leak through which the tanker spilled 20 000 tonnes of oil .
this initial leak , combined with the misjudged decisions of the Minister of Public Works at the time , Mr Álvarez @-@ Cascos , resulted in an absolute disaster and the worst ecological , social and economic tragedy ever to affect the Galician coasts .
one of the possible causes considered to explain the leak was precisely the presence of lost containers floating on the sea surface at the mercy of the waves and storms .
these containers are potential projectiles that can be thrust against the hulls of all kinds of ships , including oil tankers like the Prestige but also passenger ships , ferries or cruise ships .
the outcome of the Lashing @ Sea project has revealed serious deficiencies and negligence in the different areas concerned , such as lack of training and instruction among loading personnel and stevedores in the ports and also among the ship crews , which are consistently undertrained and undermanned even though the ships they work on are genuine monsters of the seas .
in addition , the best techniques to secure and trace the containers are , on the whole , insufficiently used , and they are frequently overloaded .
lastly , a cost and risk assessment of the new physical effects generated by these monsters of the seas needs to be carried out .
these effects include , for example , the so @-@ called &apos; parametric resonance effect &apos; , which can cause containers to drop from the rear of the ship at a faster rate .
this is why we demand that the European Commission undertake immediate preventive measures , more training , instruction and refreshment courses for stevedores and crews .
we also demand the implementation of technological safety measures : weight controls in ports , improved lashing equipment and stacking strategies , and adequate marking to locate the containers in case of loss , traceability being one of the services potentially provided by the Galileo project .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the Commission and the Council , ladies and gentlemen , relations between the European Union and the United States must be based on the maximum guarantee of security in order for our cooperation to succeed .
we must eliminate all the problems here , within the European Union .
visa requirements for citizens of four countries that form part of the 27 Member States is a serious limitation of freedom .
last week , a delegation from Parliament put this problem to the Canadian authorities and it seems that they will take it upon themselves to deal with it .
trade with the United States is important , as it strengthens our euro and puts the European Union in a position to compete with the great Chinese , Japanese and Indian markets , and we also noted a careful attitude in Canada towards the US and Mexican markets .
interacting with the United States on climate change , for sustainable energy and for the global market , is a good start to the talks .
the EU and US form the largest trade partnership , accounting for half of the global economy .
on the other hand , both partners must cooperate more closely to promote growth and employment in their own economies , especially as 30 million jobs have been wiped out worldwide in recent years by the economic crisis .
in this respect , the Transatlantic Economic Council remains the most suitable mechanism for achieving the objective of establishing a unified transatlantic market by 2015 .
I believe that during the Lisbon summit , the priority topic of the visa regime applying to all Member States must be discussed .
as freedom of movement is a highly valued right in the EU , the Commission must continue the political and technical dialogue on the progress made and on future courses of action .
I should mention that the Romanian Government has recently approved a legislative framework for setting up a national visa information system , facilitating the exchange of data with other Member States regarding visa applications .
this IT system will improve controls at Romania &apos;s borders and the EU &apos;s external borders .
this is a necessary step with the prospect of accession to the Schengen area .
Mr President , Mr Caldeira , Mr Šemeta , ladies and gentlemen , we have a very good day ahead of us , because for the first time , we can expect the Barroso II Commission to cross the 2 % barrier .
we do not really need the tolerable risk of error .
this is why the Court of Auditors &apos; report that has been submitted to us definitely represents very good news , in particular , for all of those who are working in this area .
it is clear that when the Commission makes a genuine and determined effort , it can come up with the results .
if we look at these results in more detail , it is obvious that they are in part due to the changes in the regulations .
this is definitely the case and this is the route which we must take in future .
if the Commission could bring itself to revise the directive concerning public procurement and genuinely make things simpler for public bodies in the Member States , this would certainly be the biggest step that we could take towards a positive statement of assurance .
I would like to say to everyone who constantly maintains that the European budget is exposed to major risks , it is true that European spending should certainly be subject to more consistent controls than national spending .
European money is monitored more consistently and has to be accounted for more consistently than many areas of national budgets , as always becomes clear when we visit the Member States , because the national regulations have only been put in place as a result of the European regulations .
therefore , we simply need to encourage the Member States and call on them to subject their national spending to the same controls as European spending and vice versa .
I would like to thank the Court of Auditors , but I would also like to say that I am disappointed by this annual report .
I have already mentioned that the annual report contains significantly less information than it did in the past .
we need details of the error rates .
we have always been given this information for the structural funds , but this year , for the first time , we have not received it .
we are not at nursery school here . we in Parliament rely on having this information .
when I look back at the hearing involving the members of the Court of Auditors , I recall that they promised to work closely together with Parliament .
I do not believe that this promise is being kept .
( PT ) Madam President , the brutal attack on the peaceful protest of the Sahrawi camp has stuck a serious blow to the negotiations under the auspices of the UN .
it reminded me of the worst times in East Timor : talks being held in the UN while the people were being attacked in order to thwart them .
Spain could be an advocate for the former colony that it abandoned , as Portugal was for self @-@ determination in East Timor , but it is not , as it does not wish to compromise its commercial and other interests in Morocco .
it is now known that Madrid and the UN were warned of the attack .
it is but a short step from negligence to complicity .
France bears particular responsibility for encouraging Morocco to continue with the occupation .
as for the European Union , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy only spoke of the attack weeks after it had happened , and did so in an extremely brief , irrelevant statement .
in this resolution Parliament is calling out to the European Union , demanding an international independent enquiry into the events and the identification of the dead , missing and prisoners , demanding unrestricted access to the international press , humanitarian organisations and observers , demanding that the UN monitor human rights in Western Sahara and demanding the immediate release of all Sahrawis detained in Morocco or in the occupied territory of Western Sahara .
( BG ) Mr President , I was a member of Parliament &apos;s delegation which visited Ukraine .
quite frankly , I returned with mixed feelings .
while there , we saw protests and numerous disturbances .
however , we also saw some positive signs .
I welcome the decision made by the Constitutional Court concerning the parliamentary term of office because it removes a major obstacle blocking the path to stability .
fellow Members , nearly 1 million people of Bulgarian origin live in Ukraine .
this means 1 million potential ambassadors for the European idea in Ukraine who have nothing to do with and are not guilty of involvement in oligarchic power games .
we must find a way , as part of the visa policy , to ensure that these people , who with their ancestors have been cut off from their homeland for more than 300 years , have the opportunity to travel freely to Bulgaria and export our European ideals from there to Ukraine .
applications to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are being submitted month after month .
thus , there are now eight more applications from four Member States : Slovenia , Germany , Poland and Spain .
several hundred more companies are shutting down in various industries , from car manufacturing to the textile sector via the retail trade .
in all , over 6 500 workers ( 6 592 to be precise ) have been made redundant .
that makes almost 10 000 , if we also add in the ones discussed here a month ago .
as we approve this mobilisation , I cannot avoid reiterating that what is needed is a clear break with the neoliberal policies that are causing the obvious economic and social disaster to be seen in the countries of the European Union .
palliative measures are indeed necessary , but it is the causes of the disaster that have to be addressed .
it has become increasingly urgent to implement the proposal that we made during the debate on the 2011 budget , to create a European programme for employment and sustainable development , to which 1 % of EU gross domestic product would be allocated , supplemented with funds from the Member States .
the aim of this would be real convergence , promotion of each country &apos;s potential , the sustainable use of its resources , investment in production and the creation of jobs with rights .
an agreement with Georgia would bring a wave of bogus asylum seekers .
thus , we first need to dispel our security concerns .
as the experience with the Balkans shows , visa @-@ free travel is not just used for travel to the EU , but also sets a real stream of asylum shopping in motion .
it is to be feared that the same thing would also happen in the case of visa facilitation for Georgian citizens .
in general , the facilitation of the issuance of visas to citizens of non @-@ EU states should not be granted too hastily .
before doing so , it must be examined as carefully as possible whether appropriate readmission agreements for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants could prevent the abuse of the system .
the problems with the Schengen Information System II must also be resolved beforehand .
finally , it must not primarily be asylum seekers , or even criminals , that benefit from visa @-@ free travel .
the preconditions mentioned have not been met and I therefore reject an extension of the visa @-@ free area in the strongest possible terms .
( RO ) Madam President , I would first of all like to say that I support the view presented earlier by my colleague Mr Juvin , and I would like to begin my speech by mentioning that I am sorry that the report does not contain &apos; European Union &apos; in its title .
I do not believe that we have to speak on behalf of the global community , but only on behalf of the European Union .
I have therefore endeavoured to highlight this as well in the amendments which I have tabled .
this obviously does not mean that we have to ignore the cooperation with our allies , especially , as my colleague Mr Juvin mentioned , with the United States .
I do not think that there is any great need for us at the moment to focus on a completely new strategy .
I believe that it is better to implement the strategic vision set out during the NATO Summit in Bucharest two years ago .
in this regard , I do not think that it is about devising a new strategy , but about being consistent in relation to this strategic vision .
on the other hand , we certainly need to acknowledge and learn from the mistakes which have been made in Afghanistan by the military coalition .
however , we must avoid the pitfall of seeing the pre @-@ intervention situation through rose @-@ tinted glasses .
as has already been emphasised , it is important for us to stress that one of the main objectives of our strategy in Afghanistan is to get rid of the Taliban groups from this country .
however , we must also highlight the positive aspects of intervention , especially of the Petraeus plan .
nowadays , Afghanistan is a country where women enjoy more rights , more children go to school , more factories are open and more roads are being built .
this can be attributed to the way in which we have conducted ourselves in this country .
the integration of civilian measures such as education programmes and programmes for eradicating poverty and reconstruction and development is a vital step in safeguarding peace in Afghanistan .
finally , I would like to stress the need for a pragmatic vision , as proposed by my political group .
let us not forget that more than 400 amendments were made to the Arlacchi report .
( PL ) Mr President , Malaysia is an economic tiger .
it is a highly developed country which acts as a model for the entire region of South @-@ East Asia .
this tiger faces a major problem , however ; namely , the use of caning as a punishment .
of course , one can talk of respect for cultural identity , and of the fact that we Europeans should be particularly sensitive when it comes to imposing our models on other continents .
in this case , however , we really are talking about human rights , which are indivisible and transcend the borders of continents , races and religions .
it is my view that the European Parliament not only should , but must , resolutely defend the fundamental right of human dignity , and caning most certainly violates this dignity .
in writing . - ( LV ) The European Union must actively declare its position on events in Belarus .
we must condemn the violent repression of the opposition and the falsification of the results of the presidential election .
liberty is one of the fundamental values of the European Union , and we can successfully develop cooperation only with those states where these values are respected .
that is why release of political prisoners is one of the preconditions for the resumption of dialogue between the European Union and Belarus .
with this declaration , the European Parliament must send a clear signal to the government of Belarus that we want cooperation , but that we shall never be prepared to ignore the political freedom of individuals or the falsification of election results for the sake of economic interests , especially because , more than 20 years ago , a significant part of the Members of the European Parliament were fighting for freedom themselves .
sanctions must be introduced against the Belarusian regime , but they must not impact on the Belarusian people to whom we must open a window to Europe .
European universities must accept those young people from Belarus who are excluded from universities there on account of their political activity and who will never again be able to obtain an education in a Belarus led by Lukashenko .
we must consolidate our collaboration with the representatives of civil society in Belarus , support their struggle and share experiences with them .
I am convinced that the people of Belarus deserve a democratic state where human rights are respected , where fair elections take place , and where freedom of speech prevails .
if the government of Belarus wants cooperation with us , then it will be obliged to respect these conditions .
( FR ) Madam President , many things have already been said , but I would like to echo all the words of sympathy and support that have already been addressed to the peoples of Tunisia and Egypt .
they are a symbol of hope for all those who defend freedom .
my thoughts are also with the victims .
I would now like to say that the European Union , which has been notable for its lack of reaction , as others have said , must indeed support the peoples of Tunisia and Egypt in order to help them successfully open up their countries to reform and establish democracy .
the European Union has decided to support the Tunisian leaders in their efforts to begin a peaceful transition , organise the forthcoming elections in order to win freedom and help the Tunisian people to enjoy the prosperity that comes from development and social peace , and from an economy that gives employment to the young .
I would like to conclude by saying that the Union for the Mediterranean has an important challenge to meet , as the Jasmine Revolution has unleashed a wave throughout all the States of North Africa , the Near East and the Middle East .
it must implement a strong strategy towards these countries .
a word of warning , however : faced with this legitimate democratic movement , Europe must strike a balance between non @-@ interference in internal affairs , support for the legitimate aspirations of these peoples and stability .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , first , I would like to point out that the Hungarian Presidency attributes great importance to the successful conclusion of the mutual evaluation process examining the quality of the Member States &apos; transposition of the directive .
however , it cannot be emphasised enough how important it is that we increase the access to information , competitiveness and , thus , the mobility of businesses , and , in particular , of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
naturally , we can also contribute to this by facilitating the cross @-@ border activities of SMEs .
multilingual single contact can , and indeed does , play a highly important role in this .
the Hungarian Government has always respected , and will continue to abide by , the deadlines in order to transpose all elements of the Services Directive into Hungarian law and practice .
in my opinion , the directive is appropriate , but in order to achieve its objective , it is important that all Member States follow and comply with all elements of the directive in time and observe the deadlines .
Mr President , changing the Treaty is not something we should enter into lightly , especially given the fact that the Lisbon Treaty took considerable work and negotiation .
therefore , this Parliament and the Council must be very restrained in how we now set about amending it .
this change is necessary in order to protect weaker eurozone economies .
however , the positions of those Member States who are not part of the euro must also be upheld .
this Treaty change will not solve the failure of Member States to live up to their agreements under the Stability and Growth Pact .
it will not solve the underlying problems of huge public deficits , nor will it make the EU more competitive on a global stage .
it is merely a stop @-@ gap measure that should give us more time to get the individual eurozone and our collective houses in order .
each of the EU Member States needs to look at its own public spending and tax policies and devise realistic programmes to reinvigorate our economies .
one line of text added into an international agreement , although necessary , will be no substitute for real reform and prudence .
therefore , a real strategy for global competitiveness needs to emerge .
( BG ) Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for his good work and I really hope that this report will be the last one before Croatia signs the Treaty of Accession to the European Union .
I believe that Croatia &apos;s entry into the EU will give an impetus to reforms in the region and will be a success for the whole of Europe .
Croatia recently signalled this itself by providing free legal translations of the acquis communautaire to its neighbours from the former Yugoslavia - Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , Serbia , Montenegro and Macedonia .
the country has thus shown that it is willing and able to contribute to the region &apos;s European future .
accepting Croatia into the EU will give a clear signal that the EU honours its undertakings towards the Western Balkans and that expansion is an open @-@ ended process .
I would like to highlight that although every country on our continent has its own problems , we should be careful when pointing the finger at eastern European countries , when talking about corruption and crime .
these are not a trademark just of this region , but a challenge for all of us , and only through combined efforts can we limit the negative tendencies in this area .
transparency and democracy are immutable values and it is for this very reason that we have to support and encourage reforms in the Western Balkans .
I wish Croatia all the best and look forward to greeting it here as the 28th Member State of the European Union .
in the context of the EU &apos;s future common agricultural policy , we must take into account the balance between internal production and imports .
our efforts will have to be aimed at greater harmony between market liberalisation and protection for the domestic economic sector .
food security at Member State level is achieved by maintaining a stable agricultural sector , which is not jeopardised by external trade policy , against the background of increased market volatility .
small farmers make a significant contribution to food security in the regions where they operate .
I think that trade agreements with third countries on importing agricultural products need to be concluded based on compensation for farmers in the event of possible losses .
at the same time , I support an agricultural policy which is orientated as much as possible to ensuring access for EU agricultural products to third country markets .
the purpose of promoting products with an EU regional label is to make them well known outside the EU , which , by extension , would boost their consumption .
according to recent studies , the world &apos;s population is growing at a much faster rate than global cereal production .
the EU has many regions which have the capacity required to utilise more efficiently their cereal production potential and are capable of making an effective contribution to narrowing these differences .
it is particularly significant that the debate and vote on this report seeking to draw attention to the inequalities and discrimination that persist have taken place on International Women &apos;s Day , whose centenary is being marked in 2011 .
there have been many struggles fought over those 100 years .
there have also been many victories .
however , these have not been enough to eliminate the existing inequalities , the discrimination that persists in accessing jobs with rights , the wage inequality which is reflected in pensions , the difficulty of career progression and professional achievement , and the obstacles to accessing management and decision @-@ making positions in economic , social and political activity ; the tendency is for this situation to deteriorate at times of economic and social crisis .
women continue to be discriminated against for being mothers and workers , which , well into the 21st century , is scandalous .
for all these reasons , it is important to continue to demand an end to inequalities and discrimination , which will involve a break with neoliberal policies , and a serious commitment to alternative policies that make the issue of human rights and equality central to EU decision making and policy .
I agree with the conclusions of the report , both as an MEP and as a doctor .
the damage caused by the anti @-@ social policy of most EU Member State governments will sooner or later become apparent in the health of many socially weaker groups of citizens , and particularly women .
I was led to support the previously mentioned report by concerns for the healthy development of Europe &apos;s current and future population , which is directly proportionate to the quality of health and full social equality of women .
if we care about Europe &apos;s future , in other words , the viability and development of the EU , we cannot try to solve its problems without securing equality for women .
to underrate this issue is to ignore the rights of 50 % of EU citizens .
ultimately , this may mean alienating many citizens from the EU , despite the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy includes a solution to these problems .
the EU is made up of men and women .
they embody its potential and its creative development .
as long as poverty and social exclusion apply to almost one in six citizens , as statistical investigations in the EU show , it is up to us , as MEPs , not only to challenge the Commission and the Member States , but also to mount effective pressure for the implementation of the specific measures adopted in the fight against poverty and against anti @-@ social cost @-@ cutting measures , and to limit further decline in the social area , particularly with respect to women .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I am grateful for this discussion in Parliament .
I believe the Commission will benefit a great deal in the run @-@ up to the delivery of the European framework , and it means a lot to me personally when we develop the future cohesion policy , especially the future of the European Social Fund .
I understand from this discussion that we have to go forward with simplification .
we have to go forward with making more room in the ESF for social inclusion .
we have to develop a territorial approach that suits the specific social conditions of the regions where most Roma live , and we have to do more to create employment for unskilled or low skilled people .
I want , however , to clarify two things very briefly .
firstly , poverty plays a big role , but we should not believe that the situation of the Roma as a category is identical with that of poor people in general , because poverty and unemployment are much higher among the Roma than in mainstream society .
that is why I believe Europe 2020 is a good framework and will help in developing the appropriate strategies , policies and financial support .
finally , we come to the question of why the Commission is working on a European framework as opposed to a European strategy as such .
I have no time to elaborate on this , but it is simply because of the diversity of the reality on the ground .
there is a common European problem but how it appears in various Member States , and how it should be translated into national strategies , differs from Romania to France or from Slovakia to Portugal , and we have to be aware of that .
at today &apos;s vote , the European Parliament adopted the resolution on the European strategy for the Atlantic region .
the strategy is a further European initiative which will not concentrate on solving the problems of a single country but of the entire Atlantic region , which includes as many as five Member States .
it is important to draw attention to the fact that the strategy should be characterised by a bottom @-@ up approach .
the geostrategic position of the region allows development of cooperation in the fields of maritime safety , international trade and fishing , as well as protection of the marine environment and preservation of biodiversity .
I think it is necessary to ask the European Commission what resources will be given in pursuit of the strategy , because this is particularly important in relation to establishing the new financial framework .
in my opinion , another important matter is the process of putting the strategy into effect and the possibility that it may be necessary to create additional financial instruments .
( PT ) Mr President , we should like to express here our complete solidarity with the Japanese people , and we too offer our condolences to the victims of the disaster that has struck the country .
we know that this disaster has triggered serious accidents in the Fukushima nuclear plant , the consequences of which still cannot be fully assessed .
the accidents in this plant &apos;s reactors resulted from the combination of highly improbable factors , it is true ; however , they did combine and potentially it could happen again in other nuclear plants .
we must therefore learn important lessons from what is happening in Fukushima .
there is an immediate need to review and , if necessary , adapt the redundancies in terms of the plants &apos; safety systems , particularly with regard to the cooling systems .
it is necessary to reassess the locations of existing nuclear plants , particularly according to the risk of earthquakes and the risk that a tsunami will occur .
however , there is also a need to undertake a broad discussion as a society about the energy issue , our present and future needs , and how these can be met , tackling in a lucid and informed way the risks , impacts , potential and limitations of the various sources of energy .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I rise to ask for the postponement of the vote on the Fernandes report .
the reasons are straightforward and relate primarily to the paragraph of the report which covers the House of European History .
the Committee on Budgets has been given conflicting , and I believe , misleading figures for this project .
an example of this is the mounting annual running costs : they currently stand at EUR 13.5 million .
this figure is in excess of what was originally quoted .
when I had suggested that the cost would be EUR 10 million , a faceless parliamentary official accused me of lying in the press by saying my estimates were , I quote , &apos; excessive &apos; .
this is not the way a Member of this House should be treated .
what is worst of all , Mr President , is the clear conflict of interests in having the chairman of the Budgets Committee sitting on the board of trustees of the House of European History , even if he is not remunerated .
in no other parliament would such a clear conflict of interests be tolerated .
it makes an absolute mockery of the committee process .
until these matters are cleared up , the vote on this report must be postponed .
( LT ) Madam President , the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is one of our most important tasks .
the events in Egypt , Tunisia , Libya , Yemen , Bahrain and elsewhere are remorselessly breaking down many stereotypes in our minds : that most people in the Middle East or North Africa do not care about human rights , and that they are used to living under dictatorial regimes .
the revolution in the Arab world has shown this to be a fallacy .
a few weeks ago , I visited Egypt on the day the referendum was taking place in the country on amendments to the constitution .
everyone we met talked about freedom , justice and democracy .
most stressed that they need a different kind of support from the European Union .
support is needed to strengthen civil society , establish political parties and defend human rights , so that future parliamentary and presidential elections are democratic , free and fair .
the democratic processes taking place there are very fragile and vulnerable , and we must help them in a timely manner .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , I would first like to thank our rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , for his very good report .
I would also like to welcome Mr Maystadt to this plenary because it is very important that the Commission also congratulate him and the EIB for his continued forceful response to the effect of the global financial crisis .
EIB assistance was essential .
the EIB helped us to address the credit shortage in the market and this was crucial , not only for the EU Member States and the candidate countries , but also for our partners around the world .
the EIB was able to significantly increase its lending activity and , at the same time , to target the increase to the key growth @-@ enhancing areas .
the Commission shares the Parliament &apos;s view that support for the EU cohesion policy , as well as transition to low carbon economies , are core targets for the EIB .
consequently , the Commission joined forces with the EIB Group to support convergence regimes with the joint financial instruments which we know very well - JASPERS , JEREMIE , and the new addition , ELENA - to fight climate change .
moreover , we welcome the increase in lending volume to SMEs and we agree with your call for more qualitative measures to increase the value added and transparency of the EIB Group intervention in this domain .
in this context , an assessment of the optimal division of labour between the EIB and the EIF seems to be necessary .
the huge efforts undertaken by the EIB bring into focus the importance of optimising the use of EIB capital .
it is crucial to strike the right balance between higher volumes and high @-@ risk activities which consume more capital but add more value to the EIB Group intervention .
I would like to say a couple of words on financial instruments .
we believe that the use of innovative financial instruments , together with the key financial institutions such as the EIB , should be extended .
instruments using instant loans , equity and guarantees help maximise the effects of the EU budget by attracting additional funds from third parties .
in addition , an increased use of joint financial instruments and risk sharing with the EU budget could have the effect of freeing capital and permitting a higher leverage of the EIB own resources and enhancing its reach .
at the end of the day , this means more projects in support of a Europe 2020 strategy and better support for its goals and objectives .
the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative , which is currently in public consultation , is a very good example .
the EU 2020 strategy calls for large @-@ scale cross @-@ border investment to underpin the EU 2020 flagship actions and develop smart , upgraded and fully interconnected infrastructures .
the project bond initiative would support the financing of specific projects in the area of transport , energy and communications infrastructure , and potentially also in other sectors that can help lay the foundations for sustainable future growth and employment .
I am glad to see your support for this initiative in your report .
in the context of the preparation of the Commission &apos;s proposals for the next multiannual financial framework , the Commission is carrying out a strategic reflection and analysis to ensure an optimised use of the new instruments , in dialogue with the EIB and other financial institutions , to benefit from their financial expertise and experience in the market .
to conclude , I would like to make a few remarks on the EIB &apos;s external activities .
regarding EIB financing outside the EU , the Commission supports the increase of the ceilings proposed by Parliament under the mid @-@ term review of the EIB external mandate , in particular a EUR 1 billion increase for the Mediterranean region .
we know how important that is today .
this is essential in order for the EIB to pursue its intervention at a sustained level and support the democratic transformation of our partner countries .
in the same way , we also reiterate the importance for the EIB to reuse reflows from previous investment in the Mediterranean region in order to make risk capital investment in private sector SMEs in the region .
moreover , we support a progressive reinforcement of the EIB &apos;s development capacity because these additional needs would require a gradual increase of staff resources specialised in development aspects .
in line with the Commission &apos;s proposal following the mid @-@ term review of the EIB external mandate , the Commission will set up a working group to study the possible development of the EU platform for cooperation and development .
the objective is to optimise the functioning of mechanisms , blending grants and loans involving the Commission , the EIB and other multilateral and bilateral institutions .
the establishment of such a platform would help create synergies and foster cooperation between the EIB and other financial institutions .
in this context , I would like to mention that the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission , the EIB and the EBRD was signed early in March .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Madam President , today we are discussing a legislative proposal for emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan .
this proposal was tabled by the Commission at the express request of the European Council in the immediate aftermath of the floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of last year and brought widespread devastation to the country and to its people .
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade for their hard work and their support for the proposal .
the Commission proposal aims at the introduction of a unilateral and temporary suspension of import duties on 75 export items from Pakistan .
these trade preferences would liberalise about a quarter of Pakistani imports to the EU and be available for two years , with a possible extension for another year .
the European Union is aware that such trade concessions , especially in sensitive sectors such as textiles , might have an impact on EU industry , and therefore we have ensured that a balance is kept between the needs of Pakistan and the interests of our own industry and other supplier countries .
the number of products selected is limited .
we have set a ceiling on the liberalisation of very sensitive items , and liberalisation would only be of limited duration .
in the meantime , we have also requested the World Trade Organisation to grant us a waiver of the applicable WTO rules to enable us to implement the proposed measures .
as you know , we are still discussing this issue with other WTO members and hope to come to a solution soon .
the images of people having lost their livelihoods might not be present any more in everyone &apos;s mind , but we should not forget the immense cost of those devastating floods , both in terms of humanitarian needs and economic devastation .
these trade measures are not &apos; stand @-@ alone &apos; , and come on top of the significant humanitarian and development assistance - amounting to EUR 480 million - that the EU has granted to Pakistan .
however , ambitious trade measures are essential for the sustained economic recovery of Pakistan &apos;s economy and should be part of our medium @-@ term response to those unprecedented natural disasters .
I therefore hope that Parliament will support the proposal .
let me now turn to some of the amendments that have been proposed .
I will not go into detail on all of them , but let me highlight the most important ones .
I know that there are requests for making the granting of autonomous trade preferences conditional upon Pakistan respecting certain fundamental principles .
I understand the concerns that may exist in that respect , and you are aware that human rights issues are an integral element of our long @-@ term relationship with Pakistan .
however , given the temporary nature of the waiver to address an emergency situation , the Commission believes those conditionalities would not be appropriate .
our human rights dialogue , in the context of our Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan , is the appropriate forum to address such issues with Pakistan and reach sustainable solutions .
as regards provisions that would oblige Pakistan to abstain from maintaining , introducing or increasing duties or charges having equivalent effect , or any other restriction on the export or import of certain products , I believe that such conditions would seriously undermine the granting of the preferences and are contrary to the spirit , the nature and the purpose of our regulation .
moreover , we cannot prohibit Pakistan , through this regulation , from implementing measures that are consistent with its international obligations .
on the other hand , we could agree to the introduction of a mechanism allowing the imposition of limits to duty @-@ free imports for Pakistan tariff rate quotas where volumes of imports of products liberalised increase beyond certain levels .
I also agree that preferences should be removed for any product causing or threatening to cause serious difficulties to a Union producer of like or directly competing products , as determined by an investigation carried out by the Commission .
we could also agree with mechanisms to establish customs surveillance on imports covered by the regulation , linked with quarterly reporting .
however , a prior surveillance mechanism would create an undue burden in terms of administrations &apos; licensing requirements .
I note , finally , that there are requests to limit the duration of the trade preferences to one year from the date on which the waiver takes effect .
I think that would be very problematic .
the Commission initially proposed applying exceptional measures for a period of three years .
in its compromise proposal , which was reflected in the WTO waiver request , the Council limited the duration to two years , with the possibility of extending it by one more year .
however , to limit the duration even further to one year would erode the advantages of the autonomous trade preferences measure , and they would become meaningless .
let me also point out that a compromise reached in the Council on 10 November was based on subjecting seven textile and clothing products to tariff rate quotas rather than full liberalisation .
this compromise became the basis for the subsequent request for a WTO waiver .
however , this is not reflected in the European Parliament amendments , and as a result of the consultation with WTO members , it might be necessary to subject a few more products to tariff rate quotas .
the waiver , if granted , would constitute a maximum of preferences the EU could grant to Pakistan on those terms and , as a consequence , the regulation will have to reflect the content of the WTO waiver once it is agreed in the WTO .
let me also reassure you that the Commission will conduct an annual impact assessment on the autonomous trade preferences granted to Pakistan and present it to Parliament and the Council , and that is another reason not to reduce the duration of application of this instrument .
I thank the European Parliament for its cooperation on this sensitive issue .
the Commission stands ready to work closely with Parliament in order to have this proposal adopted and show the EU &apos;s determination to act responsibly towards countries in need .
( DA ) Madam President , we have voted today on the provision of EUR 46 million in macro @-@ financial assistance to Georgia .
obviously , these funds will not be provided without imposing the conditions of responsible economic management and transparency .
that is clearly important , but it is also important to remember that the provision of this money is in our own interests , as Georgia is very important from a geopolitical point of view .
the country was hit by a double blow : first there was the war with Russia in August 2008 and then the global financial crisis .
it is still suffering as a result of a trade embargo imposed by Russia .
it is therefore in the European Union &apos;s interests to support a Western @-@ oriented government that is willing to undertake reforms , which is what we have done with the vote today .
( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by telling Commissioner Malmström that I agree with the deserved praise given to her by President Barroso for the work that she is doing in this area .
the fact that we are experiencing a difficult period with regard to migration pressures cannot be an excuse for weakening one of the major achievements of European integration : namely , the Schengen area .
Schengen is synonymous with freedom of movement , and this reality cannot and must not be reversed , but must be protected , strengthened and developed .
I also agree that proper control of external borders is essential .
if this does not happen , the security of the Schengen area is weakened , the credibility of the European Union is undermined and mutual trust is destroyed .
therefore , I welcome the recognition made by the European Commission , in its communication of last week , of the importance of the Schengen area , and of the challenge of strengthening and developing it .
I also agree with President Barroso that there is a need for greater solidarity and sharing of responsibilities between the Member States .
the problem does not lie in the Schengen rules , but in the way in which the Member States apply the rules without responsibility or solidarity .
therefore , we require a real mechanism for evaluating Schengen .
this Parliament is prepared to work in good faith to create this mechanism : a mechanism that does not apply double standards ; in other words , that is not more demanding of candidate countries than of those that are already members of the club .
however , I am concerned , Commissioner .
I am concerned about the silence of the Presidency of the Council at the start of this debate concerning this mechanism , and I am also concerned about the Council &apos;s year @-@ long silence concerning the mechanism for resettling refugees , as already mentioned by Mr Tavares .
of the three institutions , the one that is not making good progress in this area is the Council , and it should get back on track as quickly as possible .
( DE ) Mr President ,
( Mr Mann begins to speak without a microphone . )
....
1986 and the nuclear meltdown of an outdated nuclear power plant .
fearing the danger from radiation , we stayed at home as much as possible for weeks on end , only venturing outside when absolutely necessary .
a nuclear emergency was declared on 11 March of this year in the Fukushima nuclear power plant .
even in a high @-@ tech country like Japan , the promised safety levels could not be even remotely achieved .
the responsible politicians need to distance themselves from over @-@ hasty solutions .
sustainability involves compulsory stringent stress tests that examine the impact on nuclear power plants of natural disasters , as well as accidents , terrorist attacks and human error .
my country stands accused of &apos; typical German angst &apos; - quite unfairly in this case .
we need to take the fears of our citizens seriously .
everything needs to be on the table , from different timetables and decommissioning scenarios to qualified moratoriums - without false time pressures , polemics or ideologies .
the work of the German Ethics Commission should be a shining model for Europe .
workers in nuclear power plants need special protection .
the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants to expand the legal basis for the directive on disposal to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
this would also include those workers who deal with radioactive waste and spent fuel rods .
stringent criteria must apply in the areas of training and occupational safety and thorough investigations are required .
on a final note , Mr President : we must never compromise on safety issues .
this is true for the EU and for our neighbours , who must be persuaded of the importance of joint decision @-@ making .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during a hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , a Member asked the High Representative / Vice @-@ President a loaded question .
he said that , when Henry Kissinger was criticised for the United States &apos; isolationist stance , particularly in relation to the European Union , he replied &apos; There is no fellow foreign minister nor a phone number I can call to speak to Europe &apos; .
the Member then asked Baroness Ashton , &apos; Is there a foreign minister and a phone number he can call now ? &apos;
her very British answer was : &apos; yes , I do that job , although I am called High Representative / Vice @-@ President and not foreign minister .
there is also a phone number , but it is answered by a machine saying to press 1 for the British position , 2 for the French , 3 for the German , and so on &apos; .
Baroness Ashton , you have heard the speeches by many of my fellow Members , and this message is also in my report .
you have a number of voices in the world , but you listen to ours - Parliament &apos;s - more because we always support a European policy , and not just that of the Member States , to which you reply in the Council , or that of the Commission , to which you reply in the appropriate places .
I would like there to be a third place in which you could express your third loyalty .
this place is in the middle of this Chamber , behind the podium , because you are the Council , the Commission and also Parliament .
I believe this dialogue needs to be developed and strengthened in order to achieve democratic legitimacy for our external policy , directed and controlled by Europe &apos;s citizens .
we will help you carry out this role .
this report relates to the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the operating space , access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors , in a codified text .
one of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation .
on 1 April 1987 , the Commission recommended that all acts that had up to 10 amendments be codified , so that Community legislation would be easier to understand .
this would go on to form part of the conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council , which took place in December 1992 .
to address this issue , since 1994 , there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament , the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts .
I am pleased , therefore , that we can finally adopt a directive codifying Council Directive 80 / 720 / EEC of 24 June 1980 , and which approximates the legislation of the Member States on the operating space , access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I think it is important for us to have this discussion in the light of the upcoming adoption of an ILO Convention on Domestic Workers .
I believe that we in this House should commend the ILO for its excellent work .
domestic work - family caring , for example - takes place exclusively in the family home .
traditionally , of course , in the EU , it was women &apos;s work , although that is changing .
migrants and people from more marginalised communities are also more likely to work in a domestic situation .
the value of domestic work is not included in our GDP calculations and , for that reason among others , domestic work is very often invisible and is certainly undervalued .
without any doubt , this leaves domestic workers in a precarious position , and very often they have to rely on the goodwill of employers .
this is simply not acceptable .
as we say in the resolution , it leaves domestic workers more likely to face discrimination and , indeed , multiple forms of discrimination .
the importance of this ILO Convention is that it will provide legal recognition of domestic work as work .
following on from that , domestic workers should be in a stronger position to exercise their rights .
I think it is crucial that domestic workers have a right to core labour standards .
that , of course , includes access to social security , health and safety protection and maternity protection , as well as provisions on working and rest time .
because domestic work takes place largely within the family home , there can be issues of privacy involved .
we need to find innovative and workable solutions to ensuring the health and safety of domestic workers and , in the overall context , to ensure that their rights are fully respected .
one solution might be the use of model contracts .
in the canton of Geneva , for example , there is a model contract which is automatically entered into by all employers and employees : it deals , inter alia , with issues such as the minimum wage , family allowances and holidays .
I believe that contracts of a similar type operate in Belgium .
they give greater security to domestic workers , simplify matters for employers and eliminate grey areas and ambiguities .
I also want to say that I am very happy to support the amendments from the Green Group where they talk about the inclusion of au pairs and undeclared work , but come forward with practical suggestions to ensure we are proactive in ensuring access to the open labour market for domestic workers .
finally , I want to support the author of the resolution , Ms Berès , when she says that the European Union should lead the way on improving conditions for domestic workers .
Commissioner , I was interested in your words on occupational health and safety and , even though you do not foresee extending the directive , I think your comments leave some scope for flexibility in ensuring better health and safety conditions for domestic workers .
culture plays an extremely important role in the European Union , which is an area aiming to be &apos; united in diversity &apos; .
first of all , we should stress its undeniable integrationist aspect , which enables the existence of shared areas : that is , points at which people with different cultural perspectives find themselves with shared representation .
it is no accident that the report &apos;s explanatory statement begins with an interesting citation : &apos; rock and roll , culturally speaking , was a decisive element in loosening up communist societies and bringing them closer to a world of freedom &apos; ( andras Simonyi ) .
secondly , the undeniable economic impact that could result from a commitment to disseminating European culture should be stressed .
it is , then , a case of disseminating and protecting European values at global level , and of guaranteeing , on the widest possible range of levels , respect for their core aspects , such as freedom of expression on the Internet .
those are the reasons why I am voting in favour .
drugs are one of the major scourges of our society today .
this is a socially and culturally complex and dynamic problem , which is constantly changing and taking on new forms , with the use of new substances and new groups of consumers .
the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) was set up in 1993 , and its main tasks are to collect data on drugs and drug addiction , and to prepare and publish objective , reliable and comparable information at European level .
this information is vital as it provides a basis for the analysis of demand for drugs and of ways of reducing it , as well as of phenomena associated with the drug market in general .
Croatia is a transit route through which illegal drugs are smuggled on the way from production countries to consumer countries .
it is therefore crucial for Europe that Croatia provide information concerning drugs and drug addiction , and their consequences .
it is also crucial that it be able to obtain information on best practices .
that is why I am voting for this recommendation .
Mr President , I voted against the Hirsch report as it fundamentally sees education not as a means by which people can improve their knowledge and skills , but solely as a tool for increasing the profits of big business .
I completely reject that approach .
the report claims that the implementation of the EU 2020 goals is a way to secure employment and a better standard of living .
this is simply untrue .
the EU 2020 strategy will deliver neither jobs nor a better standard of living .
it offers more neoliberal policies and a race to the bottom in wages and conditions .
this report disgracefully calls for employers to be able to terminate apprenticeship contracts should the apprentices be deemed unsuited to their employment .
that is a recipe for gross exploitation .
I reject the call for the increased involvement of private higher @-@ education institutions in the expansion of vocational training and instead demand meaningful training opportunities provided through massive public investment .
I voted in favour of this report because , as it clearly points out , young people are the real resource of the future .
hence , we have a duty to ensure that they all have access to vocational education and training .
the economic crisis that has struck Europe and elsewhere over the last few years has affected young people the most .
unemployment among that age group has sharply increased , and those who do find a job have to settle for fixed @-@ term contracts and for being underpaid .
we need to work effectively and quickly in order to give some dignity back to these young people , who want to work and , above all , become part of a world in which they are unlikely to be accepted with open arms .
these objectives can also be found in the Europe 2020 strategy where it establishes the obligation to focus on smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
generally speaking , Mrs Hirsch &apos;s report is a good starting point for what must become one of the priority policies of Parliament and the entire European Union .
in writing . - ( NL ) A strong common agricultural policy with appropriate resources is necessary to ensure food safety .
this report demonstrates that there is acceptance of this fact amongst the elected representatives of the people and thus also amongst the citizens of the European Union .
when it comes to the structure of direct payments I completely support retaining the basic premium .
this is because European food production meets high requirements that add numerous costs for farmers without adequate recompense via the market .
it has been proposed by the Commission and Parliament that greening services be provided , in return for payment , as &apos; top ups &apos; to the basic premium .
I want to stress that these must under no circumstances result in an increased regulatory burden .
instead they must simply offer opportunities .
such services must therefore be provided on a voluntary basis .
the report shows that Parliament , too , is opposed to the mandatory nature of these top @-@ ups as proposed by the Commission .
I urge that , when lists of options for greening services are compiled , attempts must be made to find projects that deliver a win @-@ win for the environment and farmers , leading to further innovation and sustainable growth .
one example of this is the conversion of manure into energy .
I would particularly like to emphasise the fact that the above @-@ mentioned proposals can only be applied on a general basis if the budget for agriculture is increased .
in writing . - I particularly welcome the proposals in this report to protect and encourage young farmers , through grant schemes and other measures .
the age profile in farming remains skewed towards the older age group : 34.1 % of farmers in the EU are over 65 , while only 6.1 % of farmers are under 35 .
a reformed CAP must account for this .
reform is needed in other areas , which will mean big changes for some farmers .
because of this , the new CAP must include transitional arrangements in established sectors subjected to radical change going forward .
change is always difficult but the agriculture sector must adapt to market realities .
global demand and greater realisation of the need for food security means agriculture will be a growth area for the EU going forward and particularly important for less developed economies .
the new CAP needs to effectively target the areas of inefficiency by incentivising new practices .
for instance , in Ireland there is a need for greater scale on our farms and throughout the EU changes to traditional uses of land offer great opportunities .
for instance , tourism and recreation can be important drivers of rural economies .
that means the CAP budget must be maintained at its current level and index @-@ linked post @-@ 2013 .
question No 26 by Birgitta Ahlqvist ( H @-@ 0259 / 96 ) , which has been taken over by Mrs Theorin
subject : EU and Belarus
the development of democracy in Belarus must be closely monitored .
the Constitution confers considerable powers on the President at the same time as the parliament has a great many vacant seats because of the election laws .
allegations of election rigging have been made .
the European Parliament has protested ( 12.10.1995 ) against the authorities &apos; conduct during a strike in Minsk in August 1995 .
the EU has now concluded an interim agreement with a view to a partnership agreement with Belarus .
it has been announced that Belarus and Russia will form a union on 2 April .
what form this union will take has not yet been explained but the opposition in Belarus have protested strongly against the proposal .
has the Commission investigated whether genuine freedom of the press and association exist in Belarus ?
is the Commission listening to the criticism by the opposition in Belarus of the country &apos;s curtailment of democratic freedoms and rights ?
Madam President , I congratulate Mr Pettinari on the quality of his report .
as he has said , Nepal is a small country of twenty million people , sandwiched between giants , and of course it has not aroused all that much interest in Europe now that Katmandu is no longer synonymous with journeys of initiation , as it was in the 1970s .
respect for human rights is an important element in the draft before us .
indeed , it is actually the subject of the first article of that draft .
well , Nepal is not entirely above criticism in this matter .
the police still use methods which could be described as dubious , to say the least .
the practice of debt bondage still exists , political and religious proselytism is treated as an offence , and the treatment metered out to refugees from Tibet and Bhutan falls someway short of what one might hope .
not only that , but the country is extremely poor , and ranks among the handful of most deprived states on earth , with an annual income per capita estimated at 150 dollars ( or no more than 200 dollars according to the most optimistic estimates ) .
we are now being invited to open the way to stable , sustainable development in Nepal , accompanied by respect for human rights .
however , it should be noted that the Committee on Budgets has expressed several important criticisms regarding the conclusion of this agreement perhaps because of the absence of the financial statement , although one was appended to the agreement .
the agreement is for a period of five years , and is renewable ; be that as it may , I believe that in five years the Nepalese will have been able to receive aid , and that we for our part will be able to see things more clearly .
Mr President , the two reports we have dealt with this evening - the Argyros report and the Pompidou report - are very closely interrelated .
that is also demonstrated by the almost identical lists of speakers .
as this debate draws to its close I really wish to confine myself to a very few remarks .
first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very clear report , which has brought a great deal of order to a number of instruments that had never before been properly collated .
the devil , however , is so much in the detail here as in the implementation .
for example , we are going to need clear statements on codetermination and on the possible cofinancing of research projects by third countries .
there must also be decisions regarding the right to use the results of such research and regarding entitlement to subsequent profits .
that brings us to the question of intellectual property .
the absence of harmonized rules governing intellectual property is not unique to Europe .
we shall also have to incorporate the national rules that already exist , of course , into international agreements .
we shall have to guarantee compatibility .
we shall also have to guarantee compatibility in any joint ventures that may take place between researchers and business , something that has not really been tried out at all in our part of the world and does not exist here yet as it does in the United States , for instance .
but we also need compatibility between all the factors associated with venture capital and with mixed public / private funding .
a great deal has been said today about all these points .
there are many things we cannot regulate at EU level , but I hope that we here in Parliament - and in the Commission too - can provide inspiration and ideas so that national governments can work together to promote harmonization .
such harmonization will serve us well when it comes to cooperating at international level .
Mr President , Mr Lamfalussy , Commissioner , the reports by Professor Pérez Royo - who totally disagrees , incidentally , with Milton Friedman , the monetarist , who thinks the single currency is suicide - Mr Gasòliba and Mr von Wogau bring us back to the &apos; theological &apos; and &apos; teleological &apos; problem of the single currency .
let us consider the theological problem first of all .
is the Lord good ?
is the single currency good ?
France &apos;s strawberry producers tend to think the single currency is good because of the devaluation of the Spanish peseta .
but as it happens the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira , which are of interest to France &apos;s cattle breeders , will probably not even join the single currency , so the apparent advantages are somewhat deceptive .
and even if the Fifteen all join , the dollar will not , nor will the undervalued currencies of South @-@ East Asia , Morocco and so on . the single currency might suit the European single market , but the single market is becoming less and less European and more and more global , mainly because of the European Commission &apos;s free trade policies .
another much more serious problem is that a currency is nothing more than a vehicle for information on the economy .
it is the reflection or shadow of the economy , not the economy itself .
it is like the story of Plato and the cave ; it is the signifier , not the signified .
but trying to force 15 different economies to have the same official monetary shadow is really just forcing them to chase their own shadows .
experience shows that if you chase your own shadow , you will eventually fall down exhausted and die .
and that equates , in economic terms , with unemployment , austerity , recession and protests , even in Germany .
this brings us on to the teleological problem , or what it is all for .
the single currency may be fine , but what is it for , what purpose does it serve ?
is it Europe &apos;s objective to have a single currency , a single central bank and a single market , or is it prosperity , democracy and development ?
forgive me for saying so , Mr Lamfalussy , but when Articles 107 @-@ 109 say that the president of the European Central Bank shall not take instructions from anyone , it smacks more of oligarchy than democracy .
so even if there are some kind of parliamentary controls , they will not go very far .
and if the aim is prosperity , Mr Pérez Royo , the situation of farmers in Andalusia , Finland and France reflects what Jaurès said about money being the blood of the poor .
just look how we have forgotten what history has taught us !
we have already had a single currency in Europe and throughout the world : the gold standard .
but it did not stop deflation .
the great depression in America happened at a time when it had a fixed exchange rate with the gold standard .
I know that I will not convince you , Mr de Silguy , since this is a religious question .
at least we shall know what to think about the disasters it will bring in its wake .
market forces produce contaminated meal .
Madam President , the Socialist Group supports the report of our rapporteur , Enrique Barón Crespo .
my group campaigned for a Mediterranean policy for the EU and insisted on parallelism between our approach to the east and to the south .
it is the Mediterranean policy and its funding which we are talking about tonight and , in our view , the MEDA programme must be seen in the light of our commitment to the development of democracy , economic advancement and the cause of human rights in the Mediterranean basin .
the Socialist Group will support the approach to global MEDA funding .
but it is fair to give warning that we believe that the Government of Turkey has yet to deliver on the promises made to this Parliament before the ratification of the customs union in December last year .
we know that in the field of democratic reform and human rights abuses the situation has not only stalled but has actually deteriorated since the Turkish general election in December .
not one of the constitutional reforms brought in to charm us last year has yet found its way onto the statute book . the continuing stream of arrests for freedom of thought and speech continues to give Turkey an internationally bad name and the recent wave of unrest and hunger strikes in Turkish prisons is a demonstration of the violation of natural rights and common decency .
nor has Turkey made any effort to deal with the political problems of Cyprus and the Kurdish area .
in all these ways Turkey is found wanting , and yet it has an exceptionally close relationship with our Union and we have a right to expect more .
my group will therefore be looking to use our budgetary powers this autumn to keep up the pressure on Turkey .
we have a substantial right as the co @-@ authority on the Union &apos;s budget . we intend to use it and to invite other groups to join us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Klaß for the excellent report she has produced in consultation with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I also extend my congratulations to my colleague Mrs Barthet @-@ Mayer for the effort that has gone into her numerous amendments .
and , if I may , I should like to make a few comments on the amendments that have been tabled .
first , Amendment No 1 . on the official pretext of easing the administrative burden on winegrowers , this amendment may have the unwanted effect of making it difficult to monitor the quality of wines and grape musts .
similarly , I shall be opposing Amendment No 4 , because it makes it possible to retain the term &apos; wine &apos; for sparkling wines which have not achieved the legally prescribed excess pressure or no longer exhibit that excess pressure .
my reasons are simple : if the product is not of sufficient quality at the end of the production process , or if the storage conditions have not allowed it to retain that quality , it is logical that the product should be destroyed or reprocessed - according to the statutory and recognized oenological practices , naturally - before it is marketed .
as regards the amendments relating to the definition of crémant , about which we have just heard so much , I shall of course be in favour of Amendment No 9 , the result of a compromise reached by the Committee on Agriculture , because crémant must remain a quality product and so correspond to specific standards in terms of traditional vine varieties , pressing rates , maximum sulphur dioxide content and maximum sugar content .
moreover , the name &apos; crémant &apos; represents a particular oenological method and must compulsorily be associated with a specific region within a Member State .
so we can talk about Crémant d &apos;Alsace , Crémant de Bourgogne , Crémant de Loire , Crémant du Jura , etc . , and not just &apos; crémant &apos; on its own .
I shall be voting in favour of Amendment No 10 , and I will ask the rapporteur to accept an oral amendment from me .
this is because the amendment contains the words &apos; may be put up in &apos; Champagne &apos; -type or similar bottles &apos; .
I would prefer the term &apos; Champagne &apos; , which relates to a French registered designation of origin , to be replaced by the term &apos; sparkling wine &apos; , which conforms to the original text of the amendment and , moreover , has the advantage of being a generic expression which makes no reference to any particular geographical indication .
with regard to Amendment No 11 tabled by the rapporteur , this states that it is necessary to add &apos; the name of the local administrative area , or part of the local administrative area , and Member State in which the abovementioned person has his head office &apos; .
for many undertakings , and especially winegrowing ones , the registered office of the undertaking is located at the same place as the premises where the product is produced .
on the other hand , in the case of large undertakings , a single head office may cover a number of different production establishments .
I shall of course accept all the amendments tabled by my colleague Mrs Barthet @-@ Mayer , with who I have worked very closely .
however , I cannot accept Amendment No 6 , tabled by her and accepted by the Committee , unless the word &apos; complete &apos; is deleted .
my reason here is the statement that the term &apos; producer &apos; defines the operator who undertakes the complete production of the product .
moreover , in some regions , it is possible to subcontract certain procedures , bottling for example , a practice more commonly known as bottling to order .
however , in other regions , some wine is sold in barrel .
the definition of a producer must not be too strict , or it would result in unnecessary detail on the label and would disrupt the economic balance existing in our production regions .
Mr President , ornamental horticulture is having a difficult time at present . growth is stagnant and competition is particularly fierce as a result of free trade agreements with countries such as Morocco .
a strong boost is thus needed to sales of this economically important sector by means of marketing and promotional activities .
in this respect the Commission &apos;s creation of a promotional fund is a welcome initiative .
but the 10 million ECU budgeted for it are totally inadequate .
thanks to the lowering of tariffs on imports from third countries the Commission will lose some 60 million ECU .
in fact this is a form of subsidy to ornamental horticulture in those countries .
the 10 million ECU which the Commission is earmarking for the European promotional fund is in stark contrast to this .
it is altogether reasonable to support the promotional fund too to the tune of 60 million ECU .
together with the 40 million ECU which the private organizations themselves spend on marketing and promotion , that makes an available total of 100 million ECU which is still well below the 2 % of the value of the trade which the Commission recommended for this objective in an earlier study .
let us not forget either that this fund is the only form of European aid to ornamental horticulture .
other sectors receive enormous sums of money .
lastly , I would ask the Commission to press for cut flowers to remain in the low VAT band .
Mr President , there are four comments that I should like to make .
I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Piecyk on his powers of endurance , together with all those who have provided their political and administrative support .
secondly , I would point out the simple fact that once this procedure is concluded , the TENs will finally have been adopted .
I think it will still take a long time before we get the genuinely lasting and coherent European transport policy that we want .
it will take a good deal of hard work and there will be many barriers to bring down , barriers between countries and regions , and also between transport techniques and in the way people think , because transport affects more than just economic growth .
my third comment concerns the conciliation procedure , which I think would certainly benefit from being given a little more substance and weight , particularly in the informal phase .
the parties involved , the Council , the Commission and Parliament - but in this case particularly the Council - need to have more confidence in each other and put their arguments forward in open debate .
once this happens , the formal conciliation procedure can be kept purely as a safety net and will really hardly be needed , which will be a great advantage when you think of how much trouble it causes , not to mention how much it all costs .
finally , I would just say that I think there is no point in voting against at the moment , since that will not help anyone , nor indeed the environment .
if we do vote against , the world will not stop and wait while we go away and think again .
the compromise should , in my opinion , be the start of a whole new approach with the emphasis on policy rather than procedure , because we still have a great deal more to do .
Mr President , it will be really very difficult for us to carry out our work as Members of Parliament if we do not exercise transparency regarding our economic interests .
moreover , it is a very serious problem if Parliament is happy to talk about openness and demands it from other Institutions but has a blind spot in this respect .
the worst problem about Mr Nordmann &apos;s new report is that it merely increases the range of possible interpretations of the proposals .
this leads us to conclude that these proposals are unlikely to be realised even to the extent stated .
for example , the report proposes a distinction whereby gifts and services are divided artificially into different categories but whereby financial support obtained in connection with political activities is in a category of its own .
this is an artificial distinction and makes monitoring more difficult .
on the other hand there is clearly no prospect of any European Parliament rules permitting the notification of MEPs &apos; property .
in this connection Mrs Aelvoet already said that only in two Member States are there rules of this nature on the notification of property and Mr Nordmann &apos;s report is quite insignificant in this respect .
in response to the honourable Member I should like to say that the position of the Irish Government is well @-@ known in this regard , but I am here today answering questions on behalf of the Council of the European Union .
I reiterate what the Tánaiste said earlier in the House .
events have taken place over the last 10 days which have led to serious instability in Northern Ireland and have placed in peril the substantial achievements of the peace process over the last two years .
the origins of the recent disturbances are deeply rooted in the fundamental divisions which exist within Northern Ireland and must be addressed by achieving a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland , within the island of Ireland , between the peoples of Britain and Ireland , and by agreeing new institutions and structures to take account of the totality of relationships .
nothing can excuse the widespread violence and intimidation of the last 10 days .
violence may be an outlet for frustration , but it can only worsen an already bad situation and will not solve the problems which lie at its root .
solutions will be found exclusively through dialogue , negotiation and compromise .
it is essential that the primacy of politics over street violence should be quickly re @-@ asserted .
the rule of law must be seen to prevail and be effectively policed in an impartial manner .
a solution must be found to the issue of contentious parades which served to provoke the recent unrest .
that is what the Tánaiste said to the House this morning .
I think if people reflect on that they will find it deals with the matter raised by the honourable Member .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , cooperation in science and technology is the key to greater innovation .
Israel has highly sophisticated scientific research and is technologically very advanced so can be profitable to the European Union .
of course a reciprocal interest is needed if cooperation is to be successful .
clearly there is such an interest between Israel and the Union .
technology cooperation with Israel may provide a stimulus to industry and the small business sector and may open up new markets in the emerging information society and multimedia .
this may create more jobs .
so the Liberal Group welcomes this cooperation .
but I have a number of questions to the Commissioner .
firstly concerning the financial memorandum .
the largest single cost item is business travel by officials and European experts .
this makes quite a hole in the budget for the specific programmes which make up the fourth , and shortly the fifth , framework programme .
Parliament regularly points to the high costs of administering the programmes .
I would like to ask the Commissioner why it is that these officials and experts have to fly business class , when even Dutch government officials and scientists regularly fly economy class .
I myself flew economy class to the United States two weeks ago and I can tell you that it is just as quick and just as safe as business class .
my second question : has account been taken in the budget of the cost of translating all the forms , brochures and project presentations into Hebrew ?
this is not a European language and will be expensive .
and lastly I should like to challenge the procedure followed .
the cooperation agreement was concluded by the Commission and representatives of Israel .
during those negotiations Parliament was neither consulted nor informed even though this cooperation significantly affects the fourth framework programme .
decisions concerning the fourth framework programme are taken jointly with Parliament using the co @-@ decision procedure .
why was Parliament not involved and not even informed , despite the existence of agreements in accordance with the procedure devised by my distinguished compatriots Mr Luns and Mr Westerterp ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we utterly condemn the intervention of the Iraqi troops .
this Iraqi regime destroyed thousands of Kurdish villages in the 1980s and killed and deported tens of thousands of people by the use of poison gas .
but I also criticize the renewed American attacks , for the USA and its allies are at least partly responsible for the desperate situation in this region and in Kurdistan .
the real tragedy , however , is that it is the conflict between the PUK and the KDP , which has cost some 2000 human lives over the past two years , that made the continued interference of the neighbouring states of Iran and Turkey and the most recent Iraqi invasion possible in the first place .
the leadership of both parties bear a heavy responsibility for the destabilization of Kurdish independence , and that is the real tragedy for the Kurds .
but let us also remember that after the Gulf War in 1991 part of the Kurdish territory in Iraq was declared a safe haven .
but under pressure of the economic blockade this area has become one of the poorest and least safe in the whole world .
that too is a cause of the outbreak of conflict between the two major Kurdish parties for power and resources .
for years the Kurdish people have not really been protected against constant attacks , including military attacks , on the part of Iran , on the part of Turkey and on the part of Iraq .
there was no real willingness to create a solid basis for inter @-@ Kurdish reconciliation in the form of economic support and the international recognition of Kurdish selfadministration ; for that is in fact the only real basis for a peaceful political solution , which is the only possible solution .
but first and foremost let me urgently appeal to the Kurdish parties finally to agree a cease @-@ fire and to bring this insane war between them to an end .
question No 26 by Ivar Virgin ( H @-@ 0864 / 96 )
subject : nickel @-@ cadmium batteries
cadmium , which is found in nickel @-@ cadmium batteries , is a highly toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the liver and kidneys and may cause lung cancer .
in accordance with the substitution principle , environmentally harmful products are to be replaced by existing environment @-@ friendly alternatives .
nickel @-@ metal hydrid batteries are a type of battery already used in Sweden .
is the Commission planning to take action to speed up the changeover from nickel @-@ cadmium batteries to nickel @-@ metal hydrid batteries ?
if so , will it propose that Member States avail themselves of economic instruments to ensure that such a changeover takes place ?
Madam President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Desama on his excellent work but also have to place on record the observation that one of the problems posed by the structure of the current European economic model , backed by Maastricht &apos;s neoliberalism , is the considerable number of contradictions it contains .
in this way , the proposal to harmonize and liberalize the electricity sector may be wellintentioned but , by not taking account of the important social and political aspects involved , its consequences are serious . the three most significant of these are as follows :
first of all , the threat to jobs and the productive structure of the sector in countries which contribute with a large supply of autonomous energy - as is the case in Spain with the mining @-@ sector contribution of coal from the coalfields in the regions of León , Palencia , Asturias , Galicia , Andalusia , etc .
hence our amendment to the effect that this percentage should increase from the 15 % proposed to 30 % .
secondly , the threat to the public @-@ service character which the supply of electricity must have if a large percentage of its distribution is left in the hands of market forces , as a result of which sectors of the population in a deteriorating situation might see their position placed in jeopardy .
and , thirdly , the paradox which arises when calling for a reduction in electricity prices , since consumption will automatically increase and , at the same time , we shall be contributing to atmospheric pollution on a large scale , which runs counter to undertakings made at the Rio Conference , thereby distancing ourselves from the model of sustainable development we so earnestly advocate .
it is on these grounds , therefore , that we believe the most sensible procedure would be a global reconsideration of this proposal .
never has it been so apparent as it was this morning how the demand that the intergovernmental matters of justice and policing ( third pillar ) should be integrated into the purely Community mechanisms ( first pillar ) threatened not to improve but , indeed , to destabilize our defences , especially against immigration .
this approach seems all the more dangerous in that it is camouflaged behind a screen of making a better contribution to the integration of Europe .
the resolution just adopted by Parliament once again criticizes the unanimity procedure for Council decisions , which is accused of promoting deadlock , and consequently calls - in the alleged interests of efficiency - for the great majority of the third pillar to be transferred to the first , with majority voting , a supervisory role for the European Parliament and jurisdiction for the Court of Justice .
the Commission , obviously , is in complete agreement .
unfortunately , the actual text of the resolution gives the lie to the pessimistic finding on which its logic is based , since two full pages are devoted to a list of decisions taken by the Council , in 1996 , regarding cooperation in police and judicial matters .
it is abundantly clear from this that when the Council believes there is a real need all the governments concur , and sometimes concur very quickly , as demonstrated by the signing of the convention on extradition .
governments are all the less likely to block such legislation just for the sake of it because they are generally conscious of the sharp spur of public opinion , which is always very sensitive to security matters .
in actual fact , when a unanimous decision cannot be reached the reason is that not all governments feel the matter is urgent , so that a political problem arises .
is it reasonable , for example , to maintain that when governments fail to agree on a draft text proclaiming freedom of movement within the Union for third country nationals this deadlock proves that the third pillar is not working properly ?
I say no - it proves that it is working properly !
well , the resolution that the European Parliament has just adopted lays itself open to this precise criticism , because one can detect in it , underneath the desire to communitize everything , the desire to use this future power in the most latitudinarian manner .
in point 20 , for example , we read that this House favours the communitization of &apos; policy towards third @-@ country nationals &apos; , then in another place we find that it wants to apply the principle of freedom of movement &apos; to citizens of third countries lawfully residing within the territory of the Union &apos; .
the combination of these two approaches very clearly demonstrates the course which the Commission and the European Parliament would like to steer if they were given additional powers .
Mr President , the Weiler report is an extremely important one and has come at just the right moment , in my view .
when we talk to people in the street , they often see a growing conflict between free trade and social responsibility .
they say that the free single market is increasingly abandoning its fundamental social role , and they give a number of examples of this . the phenomenon of relocation is now on the increase throughout the European Union , technological production methods are given precedence over labour , and there is discrimination against frontier workers .
within the Member States themselves there are widening psychological gaps , such as between those in work and the unemployed , and between young people and pensioners .
this is why we urgently need a new social model which re @-@ establishes the link between social security and the real role of the economy .
the rapporteur proposes a very useful model in which our most valuable achievements are regarded as the cornerstone of society .
of course , we need to recognize a number of facts that have affected most Member States in recent years .
there have been , and still are , serious problems with financing , and most of our social protection schemes are still based on social orders which are now outdated .
what I mean is that 40 or 50 years ago , it was quite reasonable for social security to be mainly financed by contributions from labour , since it was a period of high employment .
other sources of funding were simply unthinkable .
but society has changed , and high unemployment , a falling birthrate and changes in family structures mean that there are fewer and fewer people to keep the system going , while on the other hand the need to fund the social security system from labour taxes has caused labour costs to rocket .
in my country , for example , the difference between a worker &apos;s gross wage and what he actually receives is reaching surreal proportions .
these are the sorts of conditions that kill jobs , and they are the start of a vicious circle which will ultimately undermine the very foundations of the social security systems .
one of the central paragraphs in the Weiler report is paragraph 9 on alternative methods of financing , which I think presents a very useful and fair proposal .
there is just one more point I should like to make about this whole situation .
in all the discussions on European monetary union , there is far too much talk about taxation and far too little about social issues .
it is high time that we adopted a much more practical approach , and the Weiler report sets us an excellent example .
Mr President , this evening we are talking about the status of officials and the employment of officials in the institutions of the European Community .
I believe that the European Community in particular must set an example by implementing what we are always discussing here concerning the equal treatment of men and women in all areas of our Community .
regardless of whether this is in the area of employment or in other areas , the important thing is that we should set a good example , and that we should be the ones to show what we in the European Union want .
on behalf of my group , I should just like to comment in detail on one or two points .
Mrs Lindholm has already made it very clear that people who live in a permanent relationship should not continue to be discriminated against by being given different treatment .
we cannot have a situation in which I receive equal treatment only when I have acquired a certain status , namely by landing safe in the haven of matrimony .
nearly twenty years ago I entered into a marriage because I knew that if I did so I would be taxed differently and would gain certain advantages .
we cannot have a situation in which we acquire our marriage certificates for that reason alone , and I believe that it ought to be possible for me to have equal rights without having to get a piece of paper from the state .
there are many people who live for years in a permanent relationship and who are disadvantaged purely because they have not taken a trip to the Register Office .
this applies not only to salaries , but also to social insurance , in cases of sickness and in many other areas .
I believe that in our open society it is time we put an end to this .
the second point that I should like to raise is the question of the age limit .
I should like to add something to what Mrs Lindholm has already said .
the fact that women have a different career pattern because they take time off to have children and then go back to their jobs later is not the only issue at stake .
last year , we had what was known as the Year of Lifelong Learning , and we talked about the fact that going back into education for a second time provides people with new opportunities and / or a new career .
is it not possible that the age limit would be an obstacle here ?
many people do not take their A Level equivalents until the age of 30 , and only then do they go into further education or to university , and these people then have no chance at all if there is an age limit .
the age limit must be removed .
Mr President , Commissioner , I must say that when the committee discussed the proposal for this report from this good and tenacious rapporteur , it presented a sorry spectacle for a relatively new member from the Scandinavian countries .
but I am glad that we have been able to unite across many groups in trying to correct the situation described by the rapporteur , the &apos; collapse &apos; of this report , and that we have now presented amendment proposals which we believe have a good chance of being accepted .
I do not want to speak on behalf of Scandinavia but I would still like to say that there are those watching what we do and how we vote here tomorrow , as some of the Union &apos;s credibility as a defender of women and of equality will be decided through the vote taken by us tomorrow .
for this reason I hope that the group &apos;s common proposal will be accepted .
I am also pleased that we will be able to carry out useful goal driven work on equality as a result of the proposals presented , and that there will be legal support for the intentions which both the current Commission and the Commissioner present have stated , i.e. that we are striving for a more equal representation of both sexes in the Union &apos;s institutions .
we must continuously have this at the back of our minds , otherwise hidden forces will be working in other directions and we need a plan to guarantee success .
we are also talking about age discrimination .
I support the proposals that have been presented .
as for equal status for various forms of relationship , I cannot see that this poses a threat to marriage or the family in any of the Member States .
it is more of an opportunity .
those proposals which have been put forward to recognise registered partnerships of varying sorts , other than traditional marriages , do not encroach on the law of any country .
Madam President , I voted in favour of the censure motion because I do not wish to be an accomplice of the Commission in this serious affair .
I am aware of the responsibilities of the Delors Commission , but those of the present Commission are overwhelming , because Mr Santer and his colleagues &apos; knew &apos; for two years !
as soon as they knew , they should have alerted the institutions , the Member States , public opinion .
they failed to do so , because it was Mr Major who took that initiative last spring .
as soon as they knew , they should have proposed the necessary steps to protect public health .
they failed to do so !
as soon as they knew , they should have given their loyal support to the parliamentary Committee of Inquiry !
they failed to do so .
and , today , the Commission is refusing to safeguard the moral , material and financial interests of the Community and its citizens by taking the necessary steps against a Member State .
as the protegé of Parliament , the Commission is emerging from this crisis weakened and discredited .
I am sorry to see it - it is not good for the institutions and it is not good for Europe .
a better solution would have been a strong vote of censure , to enable a new , reconstituted Commission to return to work in a healthier climate .
Madam President , we are facing a truly dramatic situation , with the risk of civil war in Albania , a risk caused not only by the collapse of the pyramid investment schemes that we discussed last month too , but also by the reactions of a government , Berisha &apos;s government , which has little by little proved to be more a regime than a government , reacting with authoritarian measures to the popular demonstrations by the Albanians and ending with intimidation of the opposition press , a government whose representative , Berisha , no longer represents the people , as we saw from those demonstrations , and which had already shown signs of lack of democracy when we condemned the elections that were held in a manner that was anything but democratic .
despite all this , he found nothing better to do than to have himself re @-@ elected President of the Republic for another five @-@ year term .
in face of this situation we must not forget either that a month ago we as the European Parliament had expressed our serious concern : the day after those elections , which were rigged , we expressed our deep concern about the consequences this could have , consequences which would , to say the least , prejudice the democratic dialogue between majority and opposition .
as early as 8 February 1994 , the Member who preceded me in this Parliamentary seat , Alexander Langer , stated that Albania was not yet a normal democratic state , that ordinary democratic life was not yet fully developed , and called on all the European Union institutions to confront this situation , for if we are not able to confront a situation such as the Albanian one , how can we hope to confront all the problems of Eastern Europe as a whole ?
for these reasons , the European Union , the Council and the Commission must undertake to promote a new détente based on the formation of a new government , on new elections held under the aegis of the OSCE ; we also propose the appointment of a special Council envoy for south @-@ eastern Europe to monitor the situation and to represent the European Union there on a permanent basis .
as has been said , if this crisis widens , it could have disastrous consequences for Kosovo , for Macedonia , and ignite the entire Balkan area .
Madam President , wherever it occurs in the world , fanaticism - religious or nationalist - leads to human rights violations and in particular to violations of women &apos;s rights .
that is no exaggeration , as we can see from the UN statistics which show that the overwhelming majority of victims of human rights violations are women and children .
wars and other nationalist or religious conflicts very often lead to the subconscious or conscious suppression of women .
women are ordered to do certain things , but are prohibited from doing others .
women must not go onto the streets , women must not receive an education , women must not work , but women must ensure that their men are well looked after .
they are raped and abused and even sexually mutilated .
and all this is often perpetuated by those in power .
a number of things need to be done as a matter of urgency .
women &apos;s rights need to be put higher on the agenda in the Union &apos;s and the Member States &apos; international and bilateral relations with countries where these kinds of things occur .
the right to asylum on the grounds of sexual persecution must be recognized , as a vital step towards ridding the world of this problem .
we must work very hard , both here and outside the Union , to have the sexual mutilation of women banned .
that is why it is vital for the UN Human Rights Commission to appoint a special observer to monitor cases of sexual mutilation , so that we can have a clearer picture of what is happening and actually do something about it .
as usual , the Commission &apos;s annual report makes for tedious reading as it concentrates only on the purely economic aspects of the EU such as finance and monetary policy .
those issues which are of concern to ordinary people , i.e. unemployment , reductions in the public sector and environmental issues are omitted completely .
so the resolution of the European Parliament makes positive reading , as it contains a real and badly needed criticism of the policy of restraint which has marked the Union &apos;s official thinking for a long time and which has been the main cause of mass unemployment and social unrest .
but we do not share the view that implementation of EMU is either advisable or desirable .
on the contrary it is the EMU &apos;s convergence criteria which are the cause of the restrictive and deflationary policies in Member States .
Sweden is an excellent example of this .
from 1990 @-@ 91 , when the Swedish government got it into their heads that Sweden must join the EU and consequently embarked upon EU type financial policies in the economy , with low inflation as the prime goal , Swedish unemployment has risen considerably even though Sweden did not become a member of the EU until 1995 .
when EMU is introduced the economic policies of the EU countries will be &apos; co @-@ ordinated &apos; and therefore no attention will be paid to the differences which exist in the different regions of the EU .
the expansive policy advocated by the report is in contrast to the EU currency policy which is why the currency policy must be changed and the notion of a European currency must be given up .
currency union ought to take other forms , compatible with an aggressive policy against social unrest and unemployment .
Madam President , the human rights situation in China is clearly poor and deteriorating further , as we can see from the developments in Eastern Turkestan .
but let me first make this point : this is the first time since Tiananmen Square that the Member States of the European Union have allowed themselves to be outwitted by China in the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva .
it is disgraceful that the Dutch presidency should have been shown up in this way after making a joint statement on behalf of the Fifteen .
the lack of any subsequent joint action , despite everything that was said , and the absence of any European resolution on the matter were a slap in the face for European unity , for the credibility of Europe &apos;s foreign policy and its policy on human rights , and for anyone who thinks he is entitled to have his human rights respected .
the Union must now try to salvage what it can .
the Member States need to present a united front in opposing China &apos;s attempts to have this issue taken off the agenda .
next , and I shall be quite honest here , the Member States must support the Danish resolution .
Denmark is to be congratulated on taking this initiative , and China &apos;s threats of reprisals are typical of its arrogant foreign policy and are a further reason for Europe to take a much harder line towards it .
the same hard line must also be maintained as regards the arms embargo against China .
it is trying to get the embargo lifted by offering major orders to France and other countries , but the Union must oppose this as vehemently as it can .
the imminent handover of Hong Kong and the situation in Tibet and Turkestan are just two of the many reasons why we must oppose any lifting of the embargo .
Mr President , I agree with the Member in saying that much progress has been made , but I would add that this progress has not been sufficient in view of the size of our task .
that is why we must work in many different directions . we already are at the present time , moreover .
I think it is very important that , within the context of the Intergovernmental Conference , which should finish with a revision of the Maastricht Treaty , a number of the proposals of the Irish presidency , which have been retained by the Dutch presidency , and which aim to write equality between men and women into the Treaty , which is one of the missions of the Community , are indeed written into it .
in all its activity , the Commission will aim to eliminate inequality , to promote equality between men and women , to apply , and I think this is very important , a general clause of non @-@ discrimination , in particular on the basis of sex , and to extend the scope of application of Article 119 of the Treaty .
another point , which I mentioned earlier in response to a question , relates to the policy of mainstreaming , which consists in integrating women &apos;s policy into all our policies , and not making of it a policy on its own .
I think , with regard to this , that it is an exercise which will go on for a long time yet , and that it will be accompanied by changes , especially of mentality , in our various Member States , and in the organisation of work .
finally , you raised a problem which concerns decision @-@ making .
with regard to this , certain actions of the Commission aim to encourage and support Member States which are launching specific action to admit women into higher positions , in which decisions are made .
we are in the process of cofinancing a series of actions , with respect to this , within the framework of the fourth Community programme .
we will draw up an annual assessment of the progress evident in Europe , by means of the annual report known as &apos; equal opportunities &apos; .
Mr President , I wish to join with other Members in congratulating the rapporteur , and I would also like to acknowledge the valuable work undertaken by Mrs Agnes Schierhuber , our own rapporteur in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
we need a clear strategy for the 21st century aimed at significantly increasing the share of renewable energy sources in our overall energy policy .
agriculture , which has been going through a very difficult period , has the potential through biomass to contribute positively to rebalancing the renewable energy deficit within the European Union .
despite considerable advantages in using renewable energy sources , consumption remains at below 6 % in the Union .
this must change , and I hope that our Member State governments are listening seriously to this debate .
biomass offers farmers and rural areas a real possibility of generating new sources of income through the cultivation of crops such as sugar beet , cereals , oil seeds , short @-@ rotation forestry and hemp .
biomass also has the added advantage of giving farmers the chance to cultivate set @-@ aside land .
at least ECU 225m are currently being spend in the EU on nuclear research .
it is high time to put real money into supporting renewable energy sources .
this is highlighted by the ongoing concern in relation to the safety of nuclear installations , including Sellafield , to which many people have referred during the earlier debate .
the time has come for the implementation of a positive renewable energy programme , rather than continuing debates , both within governments of Member States and here in this Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that this Council decision is very timely because , if we go down the way that we are going down , I have serious doubts that there can be a common energy policy , perhaps it is very difficult because there are fifteen countries with very different energy systems - and the countries which are going to be incorporated into the Union have different ones again .
but it is possible to make considerable progress with common objectives and you have very well planned this brief communication which contains the decision .
furthermore , I am pleased that the main priority is supply security .
in both the Green Paper and the White Paper on Energy you spoke first of all of competitiveness , of prices , but I think it is more important to concentrate on supply security , which is beginning to be not so clear , Commissioner .
then , of course , we should look at competitiveness , environmental protection , coordination , the possibility of having a presence in other markets .
however , it seems to me that you tend to insist on having better statistics , that we have the statistics beforehand - Eurostat statistics arrive very late because of the means we have or because countries fail to give information .
every year the Commission should carry out a far @-@ reaching examination of the energy policy of three countries , so that in five years we will have an analysis of all fifteen .
that is what the OECD does and , without a treaty and without more complications , this is extremely efficient . I think that is what is missing in the European Union .
reference is made to imposing taxes .
more than those on petrol .
now there is a new communication on tariffs and duties on energy .
I am sure that they are going to be raised .
even electricity is going to have new taxes .
these taxes are already before Parliament but have come out of the Commission ( not from Commissioner Papoutsis or from Commissioner Monti ) with an objective which seems to me to be laudable : we must create jobs , which is a major problem for the Union , and we must reduce the burdens on businessmen in terms of energy .
this is a considerable task and I congratulate you , Commissioner .
Madam President , first of all I should like to emphasize the fact that medical science is a single science and there is no such thing as &apos; alternative &apos; or &apos; non @-@ conventional &apos; medicine , just as there is no such thing as &apos; alternative &apos; physics , chemistry or architecture .
secondly , medical science has already shown what a considerable contribution it has made to protecting people &apos;s health and also to restoring it when it is endangered .
that is obvious from the large increase in life expectancy , well @-@ known achievements in the field of vaccinations , and the amazing progress in diagnosis and surgical methods .
heart surgery is now regarded as almost routine .
thirdly , I should also stress the fact that medical studies are lengthy and difficult and usually last at least ten years in all .
fourthly , in medical practice , apart from doctors themselves , there are also other scientists and professionals such as physicists , chemists , laboratory assistants , psychologists , physiotherapists and others all of whom work for the service of patients and always under the responsibility of doctors .
that could also be the case of some of the teams referred to in the rapporteur &apos;s report but he wants to make them independent and give a licence to nondoctors who wish to carry out medical practices . I am totally opposed to that .
the fifth point I wish to emphasize is that in order to tackle a medical complaint a proper diagnosis must be carried out .
the danger here is great since therapy by non @-@ doctors , without proper diagnosis of the illness , could be dangerous and it could possibly lead to a delay in treatment by proper means and that is a basic point in medical science , unfortunately not accounted for in this report .
my sixth point is that everyone knows that it is impossible for any new medicine to be used by doctors unless it has undergone lengthy and documented tests so that responsibility can be taken for its circulation , something which again is overlooked in the report .
finally , I should like to say that the health of European citizens , one of the most precious assets , must be the responsibility of doctors with whom any paramedical branches who wish to help sick people must cooperate .
so far medicine has worthily assumed that responsibility with brilliant results .
I hope that the European Parliament will reject this report because , if it is adopted , I think that we will be taking several steps backwards in the protection of the health of European citizens .
Mr President , both these reports deal with safety at sea , which is a vital issue , not just because disasters occur on a regular basis , as has always been the case and is sadly always likely to be so , but also in terms of minimizing the consequences of those disasters which are unavoidable .
that is why it is essential for the European Union to adapt itself to the standards laid down by the International Maritime Organization .
unfortunately , we do not have our own European registration requirements , which is a most regrettable state of affairs .
there are two problems which are touched on in both reports .
the first , which Mr Parodi mentioned , is the problem of language .
maybe the Commissioner would pay some attention .
last year when we had the disaster with the Sea Empress , which went down just off his beautiful native coast of Wales - I see he is in fact listening - it turned out that the only way of communicating with the crew of the Sea Empress was via the local Chinese restaurant owner because the whole crew was Chinese .
in Mr Parodi &apos;s report we insist on a common language .
with due respect to other European languages , it has to be the English language , as it is in air transport .
that is one point .
secondly , regarding Mr Watts &apos; report , despite all the good intentions , how much will it be able to control and how many ships crews will live up to the standards requested ?
we think that there is no real need for harmonisation of value added tax for the internal market to function since value added tax does not affect the comparative competitiveness of domestic or imported goods .
we also take strong exception to the two proposals in point 19 of the report proposal .
we think that the principle of unanimity should be applied in the Council of Ministers for all tax matters .
nor can there be any question of majority decision making being applied to matters of indirect taxation which are raised in the Council of Ministers .
value added tax is extremely important to the Swedish National Budget .
Sweden is a country which has one of the highest levels of value added tax in the EU .
we simply cannot agree to transfer decision making rights over an issue which is so important to us to the Council of Ministers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy to have this occasion to discuss this excellent report just before what we hope is going to be the conclusion of the final text of the new European Amsterdam Treaty .
the code of conduct on equal pay for equal work will certainly gain importance thanks to the rewording of Article 119 which finally takes into account the Court of Justice &apos;s case @-@ law and recognizes the right to equal pay for equal work .
I fully agree with the rapporteur when he declares that women should be involved in working out employment evaluation systems and collective bargaining negotiations .
as long as wage negotiations are conducted by men , wage discrimination will continue to exist .
as my colleagues have just emphasized , we should consider adopting a legally binding instrument if the voluntary code of conduct does not lead to the hoped for results .
in my country , the minister intends to impose employment assessment on labour regulations .
I think it would be a good thing if all the other Member States followed suit .
Mr President , the rapporteur rightly emphasizes the importance of a European sustainable research and development policy .
Europe &apos;s R &amp; D policy must not only be based on economic growth but must also be based on ecologically and socially desirable principles .
the Liberal Group therefore applauds this own initiative report on this subject .
however , the wording of the resolution presented to us is unacceptable for my group .
it gives off an atmosphere of the traditional struggle between labour and capital and old class wars .
the market economy is referred to as a model for smug individualism and Keynesian theories are rejected as incorrect .
but , ladies and gentlemen , let us be clear , we owe our well @-@ being in the European Union above all to the market economy .
my Group therefore cannot support recitals A , D and F. If the amendments tabled by the Liberal Group on these paragraphs are not approved , we shall then be forced to vote against the whole report .
given the current relationship , if the Liberal Group votes against the report , it will not be adopted .
my Group attaches considerable importance to the conclusion of this report .
I took a constructive attitude to the committee of inquiry , and I hope therefore that we are going to be able to vote for it .
Mr President , I always seem to follow Mr Cunha in these debates .
our opinions are the same on many things but when it comes to international fisheries agreements we often differ just a little .
the Liberal Group has put down two amendments to the Senegal agreement and one on Mauritius .
the Mauritius amendment is similar to ones we have tabled before on international agreements and it is to accuse them of not being commercial agreements at all .
in fact they are highly subsidized agreements which we feel it is very difficult to justify , except by saying that if we do not pay money as taxpayers towards these agreements , we will be undercut by major fishing nations , whether it be Korea , Japan or previously the Russian Federation .
but that is a false argument and a difficult one .
these fishing agreements should be primarily negotiated by the industry itself .
there is no real reason for the state to be involved .
more than that , by subsidizing them we are encouraging a worldwide problem of overproduction and overcapacity in international fisheries which , of its own right and economically necessarily so , causes excess depletion of stocks on a global basis .
how are we to tackle that ?
one of ways put forward in FAO and WWF discussions has been that this matter should be taken up by the World Trade Organization .
it has the powers and over the next year should try to exclude state subsidies in this fishing area as much as it is trying in other areas of economic activity .
it is no different from that .
that is why we have tabled these amendments .
in addition , my colleague Mr Eisma who is very involved in environmental issues has tabled an amendment asking for a mid @-@ term review of the Senegal agreement to check whether or not it is working correctly in terms of impact on local fisheries and the state of stocks .
we as a group would strongly support that .
I would like to reply briefly to some of the points that have been made and put the matter in perspective .
if I may say so , the views put forward by Mr Rübig and Mr Kittelmann are closer to reality than some that we have heard .
let us start from first principles .
we share with the United States an objection to the non @-@ democratic government in Cuba .
we differ as to the way in which we should handle that and we object to the United States trying to impose on us its policy .
we object so strongly that , uniquely , we have taken legislative action through this Parliament and through the Council of Ministers in order to impose blocking legislation .
we object so strongly that we went to the WTO to assert our rights. not only with regard to Helms @-@ Burton but also , although not in the WTO , with regard to the D &apos;Amato legislation affecting Iran and Libya which is equally objectionable .
we are and remain quite prepared to proceed with the WTO case .
but a strong wish was expressed repeatedly in the Council of Ministers that we should try to find a negotiated settlement .
and we have achieved a settlement of an interim kind which enables us to go back to the WTO if that settlement is not observed and if our objectives are not achieved .
what are our objectives ?
by definition a settlement means that you will not get a ringing declaration saying that we are right and the Americans are wrong in an international tribunal .
but we and the Member States have rightly taken the view that what is important is to protect the interests of the European economy above all else and to ensure that no action taken by the United States could damage us .
the consequence has been that the President of the United States has suspended Title 3 , the most damaging title of this legislation , and that since the understanding there has been no action under Title 4 .
we then entered into a negotiation which , if successful would have the effect of permanently suspending Title 3 , so that European industry and individuals were never threatened in that way , and of giving the President of the right to do the same with regard to Title 4 .
in addition , as a result of this negotiation we were given the prospect and the possibility of obtaining a waiver from the operation of the other objectionable legislation , namely the D &apos;Amato legislation .
and what has happened is that we are engaged in negotiations .
there is nothing mysterious about it .
the MIA negotiation is another matter which is broader than this and which we are also engaged in .
it does not affect the developing countries .
we hope to negotiate with them later in the WTO on a broader agreement .
the 15 October target date is a serious one and we have told the Americans that .
we are free participants in the negotiation .
there is no obligation on us to agree to anything which is not in the interests of Europe and we will not do so .
the negotiation is not concluded .
the Americans also have their task to do what is needed to satisfy us in the negotiation .
I believe that if we are successful in the negotiation , we will have protected the interests of the European Union in a very effective way and we will actually have used the WTO procedure , which is valuable .
for only by bringing the case will we have led the United States to suspend Title 3 , not to take further action under Title 4 and to do something with regard to the D &apos;Amato legislation as well .
if we do not succeed in our objectives we will have the full right to return to the WTO , to resume the case and to seek its resolution through the WTO .
therefore we have lost nothing , we have gained a lot , we have every possibility of gaining more .
if we are unsuccessful we can resort once again to the international forum which we have helped to create and which we must defend in order to achieve our rights .
that is the true position as it stands .
the negotiations are complicated and incomplete but I can assure you that we will not come to a conclusion or agree to an agreement which does not protect fully and adequately the interests of the European Union as I have defined them .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , yet another resolution on Cyprus .
one more resolution full of nice words of support for Cyprus and full of advice to Turkey and to Mr Denktash .
what is the result ?
absolutely nothing .
neither Mr Denktash nor Turkey , and I regret to have to say this , neither the Council nor the Commission attach any significance to the resolutions of the European Parliament .
and if that was not enough we also have paragraph 5 , which refers to the S300s .
ladies and gentlemen , are you not aware that in occupied Cyprus there has been a Turkish army of occupation for twenty three years ?
are you not aware that there are 40 , 000 Turkish soldiers in Cyprus ?
are you not aware that there are heavy weapons ?
are you not aware that there are tanks and aeroplanes ?
in the name of what legal authority of the European Union do you reject the right of the government of Cyprus to organize its own defence ?
since you know very well , ladies and gentlemen , that the S300s are weapons of defence and not weapons of aggression , unless we are expecting that one fine morning Mr Denktash will occupy the rest of Cyprus and we will continue to put forward resolutions while the whole of Cyprus falls to the army of occupation .
unless , ladies and gentlemen , and I regret to say this but it is the hard truth , we are annoyed that the S300s are purchased from Russia and not from the European Union , that is to say , from France , from Germany or from the United Kingdom , or even from America .
it seems that when a missile bears a stamp saying &apos; made in the United States &apos; or &apos; made in Europe &apos; it is a good missile , since this is the impression that you give me , and I regret that in this resolution , which will have no significance whatsoever , there is this paragraph .
ladies and gentlemen , we are trying to cover up a reprehensible fact .
Mr President , my reply to the first question from Mrs Günther about anti @-@ personnel mines , is that this is an urgent and fundamental matter in Cambodia , but not one of the aims of the cooperation agreement as such .
it is a problem which exists in the area , but it is not part of the agreement .
what are we doing about this problem ?
well , for some time now the European Union has had some very intensive programmes to rid Cambodia of mines , and we have been working very hard to try to resolve the problem .
my opinion on anti @-@ personnel mines is that their manufacture should be halted world @-@ wide .
in other words , there is no problem in this respect .
furthermore , I believe that the whole of the European Union thinks the same way .
as for monetary stabilization , as you well know the Commission does not have financial powers , and unfortunately the euro still does not exist .
will the European Union be able to intervene the day the euro comes into existence ?
you are asking me a question which I cannot answer .
you know better than I that as yet the European Union has no external responsibility in financial matters .
perhaps from January 1 , 1999 , when the euro has responsibilities internally and externally , the European Union may perhaps be able to intervene by means of normal participation in the international financial institutions , for example the Asian Development Bank which is a World Bank regional bank .
however , as things stand we do not have the means or the ability , not even internally .
this is a debate for the future .
if you want my opinion , I am in reasonable agreement with the views expressed by the Director General of the Fund , Mr Camdessus , in Hong Kong .
globalization is fine and so is free movement of capital , but there are of course certain objective limits which must be adjusted to make sure that the positive aspects of globalization do not turn into a powerful element of destabilization , particularly in those countries with the weakest economies .
as for the fires in Sumatra , it was said that the early warning system did not work .
I do not understand your question , Mr Telkämper .
Madam President , this topic - the European Parliament and Council Directive on the legal protection of designs - has been occupying us for some time .
at first reading , the European Parliament tabled a series of amendments .
the Commission corrected and modified some of those amendments , and added its own .
the matter was referred to the Council , which rejected most of the European Parliament &apos;s amendments .
the scope of the directive is broader than the public sometimes realizes , because it is mainly concerned with the legal protection of designs .
in contrast to other types of industrial property , which could be termed functional - being concerned with making things work , design introduces an artistic element .
you could say it is artistic property and should be considered an aspect of intellectual property .
therefore , we are not so much interested in whether the machine works or not , as that its visible appearance should contribute to a harmonious overall effect .
so there are elements here that could be termed artistic property rather than industrial property , strictly speaking .
the Directive is not restricted to the legal protection of a specific type of design , but covers them all .
we are talking about protecting textile designs , for example , or designs in glass or plastic - all the types of design which may be involved in a given industrial product at a given time .
that is the nature of the Directive in general , but I think the problems fall into two classes : those concerning the general properties of the design , and those which specifically concern the notorious question of spare parts .
it seems to me that there are not too many differences of opinion about the first , more general problem , which involves protecting industrial designs by means of a harmonization directive .
this has led the Council to believe that this matter could be resolved by leaving the other problem - about the protection of spare parts - to one side .
discussion of spare parts starts with an almost philosophical question : do we protect the overall design of an industrial product , or just a part of it ?
I remember when I was a child , if a radio or something got broken , it was sent to be repaired .
today , as we all know , repairing most manufactured items is more expensive than buying them in the first place , and therefore the question of spare parts does not arise .
if a watch breaks , we normally throw it away and buy a new one - unless it is an antique , when industrial considerations virtually cease to be relevant .
the question has arisen in relation to spare parts for cars , specifically external parts .
when there is a serious accident in which people are killed , normally the car is a write @-@ off , but most car accidents happen in our cities , when somebody comes too close alongside and the car gets scraped , resulting in damage to the door or mirror , or perhaps just the bumper .
because of this , the spare parts industry is becoming important in many European countries .
when a spare parts producer copies a design from a specific car , perhaps a luxury model , and puts it on the market , the manufacturer of that car claims that their intellectual property is being violated .
other people disagree , saying that design protection should only cover the overall design and therefore , if a single part of the design is damaged , that part is not protected .
at the moment legal opinion is sharply divided . in the United Kingdom , protection is not currently granted to individual components , and in at least two other European countries legal opinion is also beginning to deny this protection to the original manufacturer , and grant spare parts producers the right to substitute components in various ways .
my viewpoint as rapporteur for the first reading was that protection should extend to components , but this was thrown out by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights , whereupon I gave in gracefully and accepted their opinion .
the committee proposed an intermediate solution , whereby spare parts manufacturers would be allowed to use the designs in question - or at least those parts of them involved in the repair- but would have to pay compensation to the car manufacturer .
this solution was a compromise between the two positions and established a system based on compulsory licences .
the Commission seems to have been happy with this , and decided to go ahead with it .
the Council disagreed , however , and said it was a judgement of Solomon .
we believe that from Parliament &apos;s point of view this is the worst possible solution . there is nothing worse for the internal market than leaving things undecided .
problems must be resolved in order to provide a certain stability for commercial and industrial relations , and investment . this stability can only be achieved by finding a solution - either good or bad .
the worst solution is no solution at all .
therefore , Parliament has reintroduced most of the first reading amendments , making use of the Commission &apos;s improvements to the text .
there are a few other , less important , amendments .
for example , there is a clause relating to visible and invisible motorcycle components .
but on the whole , the situation is that the Council has rejected Parliament &apos;s proposals and wants to shelve the matter , whereas Parliament is proposing a solution .
I hope the members of the Council will be able to resolve their differences . because , as we all know , the real problem is that some Member States in the Council favour one solution , while others would prefer another .
as for Parliament , I believe we have fulfilled our obligations by presenting this set of reasonable amendments , designed with compromise in mind . these amendments were supported by the Commission on a previous occasion , and are perfectly capable of being upheld before the Council .
in other words , Parliament &apos;s position is totally constructive .
we have a great interest in seeing this directive adopted as soon as possible , in order to harmonize the whole question of industrial design .
on the other hand , however , we insist that the ensuing regulation must be correct and solve the problems adequately .
therefore , I call upon this House to support the amendments which have been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights .
Mr President , I will start with Mr Tomlinson &apos;s excellent report , on which I should like to congratulate him .
it is the result of a great deal of work . I shall therefore vote in favour of it this time , which I did not do in committee .
nevertheless , I should like to take this opportunity to point out that this work has been flawed , even plagued , by a series of populist and demagogic amendments , which can only act to reinforce the prejudices which were seen , for example , in the television programme we were talking about yesterday in this House , and which end up damaging the institution &apos;s prestige .
Parliament is paying for the consequences of the Council &apos;s lack of political will in considering it unnecessary , until Amsterdam , to have a Members &apos; statute .
there was an Officials &apos; Statute , a Commissioners &apos; Statute , a Statute for Members of the Court of Auditors and a Statute for the Advocates @-@ General of the Court of Justice ; but there is no statute for Members of the European Parliament .
this has had a series of adverse effects on the system by which parliamentarians are paid .
I think it is high time this was resolved once and for all , throughout the whole system .
any half measure will only create dissatisfaction and unfairness .
that is all I want to say on the matter .
ladies and gentlemen , I come now to the general budget .
I want to thank Mr Tillich for his work , but there are too many ad hoc procedures . there are proposals for amendments in the resolution but not in the budgetary section ; there are too many letters of amendment ; and there is the Council &apos;s commitment to approve a legal basis for actions against unemployment , which have still not been approved in time for the first reading ; and so on , and so on .
in any case , my dear Mr Tillich , Mr President , if we were to ask a normal person whether they had understood any of this , I think the answer would be no .
therefore , I believe that this budgetary procedure provides evidence that the Treaty of Amsterdam left a lot to be desired , in not updating article 203 . I think that is very clear .
ladies and gentlemen , I am not going to harp on about the question of the Meda programme , but I will say that I find it surprising that two weeks ago we voted to congratulate the Commission unusually warmly on having implemented the programme so well , and now in the budget , we are trying to put part of its funds in the reserve .
as for the structural funds , I think this year &apos;s formula is a good one , since we can now count on having enough money to provide for the structural funds in full . I should like to thank the European People &apos;s Party for changing its mind since last year .
in this sector the structural funds are spending objectives , and an attitude like that seen last year could result in a very grave future commitment .
ladies and gentlemen , I should like to conclude by mentioning the employment initiative .
I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency for the initiative itself and for its commitment , and I have complete trust in President Juncker .
but I hope you will not mind me saying that I do have a lot of doubts , and am worried about the attitude of some members of the Council . I would not like to see Parliament sacrifice part of the non @-@ compulsory expenditure which it has at its disposal just for the sake of a news story on television the day after the extraordinary summit in Luxembourg .
ladies and gentlemen , I think our amendment on this point is just a sign of our misgivings , as Mr Fischbach so diplomatically said .
we hope that the Council &apos;s decision in a month &apos;s time will show us that our misgivings were unfounded .
furthermore , ladies and gentlemen , it is now time to mobilize the whole Community budget , to unblock other initiatives directed against unemployment which have been blocked by the Council for some time , so that the whole of the Community budget can be proemployment , and so that we can motivate the people of Europe and prepare the Union for enlargement .
Mr President , as has previously been said here , it is almost seven years since the Commission presented this proposal on the protection of personal details and private lives in public digital telephone networks , i.e. the GSM and ISDN networks .
the aim was that the proposal should guarantee protection for all EU citizens with regard to information found in these various public and private lists .
on the second reading Parliament approved the proposal with 13 amendments , including an amendment saying it should cost nothing to have an ex @-@ directory telephone number .
the Council was unable to accept all these amendments , especially not the proposal about ex @-@ directory telephone numbers , which is why the question was referred to the Conciliation Committee .
I do not think the question about the extent to which a charge should be made for ex @-@ directory telephone numbers has really been answered ; i.e. where this kind of listing of citizens is concerned , whether people should have the right to remain outside such a list at no charge .
that also applies to people who are at special risk .
I certainly think that Parliament has drifted a little away from its original standpoint .
when the European Parliament &apos;s delegation reached agreement on this compromise proposal only four people were actually present , where there should in fact be fifteen people .
I also think it is debatable whether this is a question which requires an EU directive to set binding standards for the Member States at all , since the consumers &apos; interests are not quite satisfied and not fully protected .
my group is therefore actually considering voting no to the proposal .
Mr President , I would like first to congratulate our rapporteur , and the Commissioner , for the quality of the work she has carried out on so delicate a subject .
the question required special attention , and substantial measures are required if this problem , which is nothing short of a plague , is to be put right .
I have nothing to add , either in form or substance .
I would rather emphasize the necessity of attacking the root of the evil , which affects the most disadvantaged women .
the root of the evil , as our rapporteur has reminded us , is the situation of disproportionate inequality between the economies of the rich and poor countries , and the inequality of economic resources devoted to men and women .
poverty and unemployment are the reasons for the growth in this trafficking , which holds out to the women who are victimised by it the illusory hope of a better future .
this is the field where we need to concentrate our action a little more .
I would also like to mention the situation in the central and eastern european countries , where the whole of this problem has taken on considerable proportions .
let us simply express the hope that the opening of the European Union to these countries will enhance our ability to control this problem , especially as women from the central and eastern european countries who are involved in this trafficking are young and educated , and therefore should have better chances of entering the employment market .
on the other hand , women from the developing countries are older , less well educated and have poorer prospects for the future .
the problem is most acute in the African and Latin American countries .
women from these countries use subterfuge to obtain long @-@ stay residence permits in the Union .
in conclusion , I would say that while I express no doubt as to the effectiveness of the measures proposed , I believe , quite simply , that we should step up our efforts at improving the economies of these poorer countries .
this is the only way to put an end to this unscrupulous exploitation of human wretchedness .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for , as usual , a well drawnup and very good report .
society is changing ever more rapidly .
in the old industrial society it was the person who owned the money who had the power and influence .
in the new society which is emerging , it is increasingly the person who possesses knowledge who is also going to have power .
in the old society power was unequally divided between those who had access to money and those who did not .
there is also a risk of such an inequality in the new society , if we do not ensure that everybody benefits from education .
that is the most important issue .
education is going to be increasingly important .
if we are to have an equal society in future we must ensure than everyone , men and women , those who are now poorly educated , the unemployed and others can share in the education society , can share in basic education and can share in life @-@ long learning .
that is one factor .
the other factor is that we must ensure that when we obtain an education we obtain one which can be used for a long time .
there has to be a broad basic education , because society is changing ever more rapidly .
it is not possible to have a quick education .
furthermore , there has to also be life @-@ long learning .
working life and education must be fully integrated .
both society and the social partners have a responsibility in this work .
society has a responsibility by providing sufficient resources , by creating an active labour market policy , by creating a tax policy which encourages education and by creating a social insurance system which also provides the opportunity for education .
the social partners have a responsibility , because in future it will not be possible for people to simply sit down and negotiate about loans and general terms of employment .
it will be increasingly important to include education as part of the negotiations .
I was myself responsible for a report a month ago concerning changes in the organization of work .
there are clear connections .
the most important question if we are to develop new organizations of work is to have a welleducated workforce , and a workforce with a broad education , because organizations of work are going to have to be changed according to the needs of the time .
so a workforce is needed which is also capable of meeting the needs of the new era .
finally , I would once again like to thank Mrs Waddington .
these are excellent proposals , concrete proposals on best practices , on using the structural funds and on improving the statistics .
I hope that the Commission listens to them .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Freddie Blak for the work he has done on this report . it has been a hard fought for report and his endeavours have been greatly appreciated across the board inside the committee .
while it is technical , it is also very real .
in fact ten million people across the European Union suffer an accident or illness at work .
this is a well @-@ known fact and eight thousand of these people unfortunately die every year within the European Union .
many other unreported accidents , illnesses and deaths go by the board , of course .
many of these deaths and illnesses arise from ignorance and the taking of unacceptable risks .
as long as these risks are ill @-@ defined , it is right that the Commission should introduce legislation to mark these risks quite appropriately .
why do people take unnecessary risks ?
we all do it now and then .
we all cross the roads , perhaps without looking , and we all take inappropriate care .
this is a bad attitude for life , and definitely a bad attitude for work , but these attitudes can be dismantled and reassembled in a progressive and positive way to stop the kind of problems we face at work .
this is why this report , which is unlocked by the UK Presidency &apos;s initiative as Freddie remarked , aims at stopping the inappropriate behaviour of the use of noxious chemical agents which are some of the worst chemical agents that people can use at work .
the hazards of using such chemical agents , must be assessed as to the risk for workers , not just from the immediate effects but the long @-@ term effects as well .
the training notices must have a substantial impact as well as training itself .
this is why such importance has been given to training in this report , to the extent perhaps of widening the framework directive &apos;s interpretation of training and that is a welcome move .
in small businesses , for example , workers are 50 % more likely to suffer from an accident at work .
why is this ?
it is because there has been better training in larger companies and appropriate notices , none of which are obvious within smaller companies .
also , in larger companies risk is taken seriously because health and safety is regarded as a productive and profitable element for the future of any company structure .
this is why the Safe Action for Europe project , which unfortunately cannot get past the question of a legal base , would have been quite appropriate for small businesses .
Freddie has also mentioned relocation of chemical production and companies .
I remember the case in Bhopal , India .
low social costs were given as the reasons for this .
this meant that Bhopal is remembered as a major disaster and for total exploitation of the workers in that country .
we must not forget that , if this is a directive which adds to the sum total of European workers &apos; rights , perhaps we could be exporting this type of model elsewhere in the world .
certainly we must not let capital get away with simply exporting the dangers and disasters which we know beset this minefield in this particular Continent .
it is progressive enough for us to feel that it will be significant in protecting workers and yet it is also realistic enough to produce results .
Mr President , I had the honour of taking part in this mission with Mrs Pack , which I believe was the first tri @-@ parliamentary mission in the history of our Parliament .
it is an extraordinary event and we can certainly be satisfied with it , but satisfaction with the result of this mission should not be confused with a calm state of mind in relation to the internal situation in Albania because , as Commissioner Marín has just recalled , the situation remains worrying from an economic and safety point of view .
we have to realize that a race is taking place in Albania and we do not yet know who the winner will be .
on the one hand , there are those who want a process of national reconciliation and an effective democracy and , on the other , there are those who still want revenge over the electoral process .
it is true that in Albania , compared with a year ago when there was a kind of civil war , there is now a parliament and a government and constant efforts are being made to put things back in their places . it is true that the situation has improved , but if the government and the opposition do not soon work together to cooperate and complete the new constitution in the parliament and if there is no cooperation within the parliament itself , then conflicts will emerge outside parliament , throughout the country , and the arms used will not be those of deliberation and democracy .
every day , the press reports news that , luckily , does not end up on the international pages , because it concerns local incidents of deaths and injuries , and fights for which those responsible are often not easy to trace .
the constitutional block in Albania was the fundamental reason for this mission .
the cooperation of all the political powers is required to draw up a constitution .
the opposition , however , has not yet participated in the work of the Committee on Institutional Affairs , giving as a reason , the fact that the parliament does not have the moral authority to rewrite the new constitution , and this gives us cause for concern .
with our tri @-@ parliamentary mission , we sought to convince all our partners that a parliament , formed as a result of a laborious response from the ballot @-@ boxes but also universally recognized as acceptable , is a parliament that is also legitimized to draw up the new constitution .
we said , however , that we needed to overcome this block ; it seemed to us that our words had been heeded with renewed attention and we had the feeling , as Commissioner Marín pointed out a short while ago , that in the days immediately following our visit , new political events took place .
nevertheless , there was no specific or material follow @-@ up to the declarations made immediately after our visit and , since our return , there has still been no follow @-@ up within parliament and the Committee on Institutional Affairs as regards working together on the new constitution .
simple declarations must be made : we need to insist that the Council and the Commission follow our tri @-@ parliamentary mission with further measures .
I have heard positive comments in this respect .
we , as members of this Parliament , will have to comply with two commitments we have assumed in this respect : firstly , the formation of an international group of advisers with the task of contributing towards the definition of the status and content of the new constitution ; and secondly , the observation of the parliamentary work in Albania .
in a fairly delicate context , we wanted to illustrate the requirement that the three organizations should dedicate themselves to observing the parliamentary work , with the agreement of the Albanian parliament .
having said that , other things are also useful .
to give an example , and addressing Commissioner Marín and the President @-@ inOffice of Council in particular , I believe that we should establish roots in the territory because , although the national government has good intentions , we cannot take it for granted that its supporters throughout the country have the same good intentions of working towards national reconciliation . to use an image , there is still fire smouldering under the ashes !
we therefore need to ensure that democracy flourishes in the territory , at local level .
I have heard talk of initiatives the Commission would support financially .
in this context , I would suggest that financing be assigned to a particular twinning project between the Albanian local authorities and the local authorities of our Member States . this would create a network of connections that would allow democracy to exist at local level throughout Albania , and would help overcome the temptation to resort to arms , by establishing a common desire for reconciliation .
the decision to proceed with the Single Currency is premature and has been forced along by political considerations rather than concern for economic growth and lower unemployment in the EU .
I am concerned at the effect which this premature decision will have on the people I represent in Northern Ireland .
as the Maastricht criteria have been disregarded in the case of some of the eleven countries , particularly Belgium and Italy , the euro project itself begins on very insecure foundations .
the introduction of the euro will have as much effect on those countries which remain outside the project as those which go in the first wave .
my constituency is the only part of the United Kingdom which will share a land frontier with a participant country .
therefore I am extremely concerned that the negative impact which Belgium and Italy are bound to make on the project will have repercussions in my local economy .
I am pleased that the UK Government has adopted the responsible position of not participating in the first wave .
the Euro project has the potential to undo the success of the EU .
the UK Government has wisely decided not to throw the British people into the unknown .
G . ( SV ) We certainly feel that it is important for action to be taken to combat crime within the payment card industry .
it is absolutely clear from the explanatory statement accompanying the report that the proposal should concentrate on such areas as the production of payment cards , their distribution , production of card readers and other payment card @-@ related services .
all of these areas are important .
we are wondering , however , whether this is a specifically EU @-@ related problem .
we believe it is not .
the measures mentioned here are all international .
quite clearly , payment cards do not exist only in EU countries .
consequently , we do not feel that these matters should be entrusted to Europol , but instead that Interpol , the international , intergovernmental police commission , should take the matter up .
fraudulent payment card transactions are international and therefore a job for Interpol .
we have thus voted against the legislative resolution .
Mr President , in the short period of six months it is hardly possible for a Council Presidency to have a strong impact on the European political process .
that is why continuity and cooperation between successive presidencies are all the more important .
however , our citizens are given the impression , conveyed in part by national media , that each Presidency functions in historical isolation .
every six months Europe is invented anew , so to speak .
my question to the British Council Presidency , therefore , as an Austrian Opposition politician , is this : in July , do the Austrians start again from scratch , as seems to be the case , or is there genuine co @-@ operation between the British Presidency and the future Austrian Presidency which will ensure that processes already begun will continue to run smoothly ?
if the answer is yes , in which areas is there agreement , and where can Austria build on preparatory work by Britain ?
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Agenda 2000 caused a great commotion but there is , as yet , no coordination to be seen , as the Member States are rejecting the Commission &apos;s script .
heated fights for allocation , owners of assets who make their presence felt - and in the midst of all this , we lose sight of what is actually at stake ; the great , great settlement with central and eastern Europe .
but what are the rules of the game ?
the first is that enlargement is only possible if the agricultural and structural policies are reformed .
secondly , some better @-@ off regions are excluded from current aid , and indeed this applies both to Germany and to Sweden or , for example , Spain .
if the German Länder demand that budgetary risks for the Länder be prevented in the finance regulations , it is recommended that they use the interim deadline of four to six years to guarantee this for themselves .
thirdly , unlike the previous speaker , I believe the Cohesion Fund should be dissolved following monetary union .
however , if the Spanish government and others wish to cling desperately to it , it should be said honestly - and the rapporteur does allow this opportunity - that we cannot in principle deny Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Slovenia and Estonia access to it ; this is the logic of the game .
those who demand things for themselves also achieve things for others .
fourthly , if we are going to haggle about money , then let us do it properly ; this would mean clarifying the net contributor debate , particularly as far as Mr Waigel is concerned .
the justice gap can only be closed on the income side and not on the expenditure side .
those in favour of reform must also be in favour of dismantling agricultural subsidies .
a reduction of the British rebate in agricultural subsidies and a possible move to co @-@ financing would at the same time pave the way for a general corrective mechanism .
if we adhere to these rules , there will be some kind of coordination and we will have a script which will finally allow us to reach the end of negotiations .
Madam Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we must be careful - in the context of the solidarity always mentioned in connection with economic cohesion of the Union - not to repeat the fairytales told to us by the Council and other powers , sometimes even the Commission .
on the one hand , we cannot plan , with the approval of all Member States , an enlargement of the kind that is obviously planned here - the poorest and most sizeable enlargement which Europe &apos;s history of integration has ever known .
on the other hand , we cannot believe that we will have to pay less than in the past or indeed that we can maintain existing structural policies and Member States &apos; incomes as they were in the past .
our fellow citizens will not accept this and indeed it is also an insult to our own intelligence .
thus , it will be a question of proper distribution .
in this regard , some colleagues are indeed right .
we not only have a north @-@ south conflict in the area of cohesion but also , to a certain extent , a north @-@ north conflict .
here I must point out to some of the preceding speakers that there is no point in only considering structural policies as such .
of course , no later than October , when the Commission adds up the income side of Agenda 2000 and says that this country has to pay so much and that country has to pay so much , we will have a new debate on expenditure in category 2 of the structural policies .
for this reason it is also important that we include , for example , expenditure on agriculture .
the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cannot make its own decisions on this and say that none of it is its concern .
I am directing this particularly at our Bavarian representative here .
of course , this is to be included as , if we have major new tasks ahead of us , and that is a certainty , then it poses a challenge to our solidarity .
then it will no longer be possible for the second richest country in this Union to be a net beneficiary because of this - crazy - agricultural policy ; then our fellow citizens of the Union will no longer accept such a policy .
Mr President , as you know , the Conference of Presidents changed today &apos;s agenda , and Mr Pompidou &apos;s report should have been this morning .
he had agreed to chair the board of examiners for a thesis student and unfortunately he could not leave the candidate in the lurch .
this is why I am replacing him and I will repeat what he would have said if he had been present .
in vitro diagnostic medical devices are taken to mean reagents , instruments and equipment for the examination , for medical purposes , of tissues or substances from the human body .
unlike medicines , in vitro diagnostic tests are used outside the human body in order to allow medical tests to be carried out on samples taken from patients .
such devices are thus essential tools for the diagnosis of illnesses , the monitoring of treatment and now even research into the predisposition to certain genetic disorders , thanks to the recent development of genetic tests .
these devices are mainly used by pharmaceutical laboratories , doctors and specialist pathologists .
however a growing number of these devices are intended for use by patients themselves - for example , measurement of blood sugar levels in diabetes and for pregnancy testing .
in such a context , any diagnostic error would have serious consequences for the health and treatment of patients . you will easily understand this as it relates especially to diagnosis of the AIDS virus and hepatitis .
the common position thus lays down the essential requirements which the devices must satisfy to be able to be placed on the market and the conformity assessment procedures to be applied by the manufacturers .
the Council has taken up most of the amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading .
thus the common position seeks to establish a balance between the aims of freedom of movement and protection of human health .
in fact it enables monitoring and follow @-@ up of the quality of products , based on reacto @-@ vigilance measures .
it would nevertheless be worth clarifying a few points , namely those which are the object of the six amendments , especially the more general ones .
amendment No 2 insists on the need to draw up - as quickly as possible - the legislation that is lacking on medical devices manufactured from substances of human origin , which are currently not covered by the scope of the directive .
amendment No 3 aims at avoiding any distortion in competition which may be caused by certain Member States &apos; own regulations with regard to devices for self @-@ testing .
amendment No 4 ensures that instructions for these same self @-@ testing devices will be translated into the language of the final user .
outside the laboratory the patient must be able to understand the instructions easily in order to avoid all possible error in the use of the test .
amendment Nos 1 and 5 enable the quality and safety of two types of new test to be taken into consideration .
amendment No 5 relates to the diagnostic device enabling the risk of trisomy 21 in the first few weeks of pregnancy to be assessed , whilst being aware of the fact that it relates only to an assessment of the risk which will then require further screening methods , carried out with the well @-@ informed consent of the parents @-@ to @-@ be .
amendment No 1 covers genetic tests , in particular the use of high @-@ density DNA micro @-@ chips , which are the components of genes .
these devices enable genetic diseases , and a genetic predisposition to certain diseases , to be very rapidly and reliably identified .
given these conditions , our rapporteur Mr Pompidou fully subscribes to Amendment No 6 , proposed by the Green Group in the European Parliament .
based on the Council of Europe &apos;s Convention on Bioethics , this amendment aims to avoid any discrimination on the basis of genetic tests .
he will thus propose an oral amendment at the time of the vote tomorrow , which adopts the precise words of the Council of Europe &apos;s Convention .
progress in diagnostic methods leads us today to take precautions regarding the quality and reliability of tests , but also to avoid any improper use which could endanger human dignity .
this is the aim achieved by the common position and sought by the rapporteur &apos;s amendments .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , the President of Eritrea recently replied , when asked about the reasons behind what had happened , with a very simple statement : &quot; it is very difficult to give an easy answer &apos; .
and the President of Ethiopia , referring to the incidents , said : &quot; I was surprised , shaken and disoriented &apos; .
I am sure you will understand that the most surprised and disoriented people seem to have been we Europeans , because there is not the slightest doubt that , despite having had strong historical relations with that part of the world - particularly some of the Member States of the European Union - , it appears in this case that nobody knew anything .
and one of the points in our motion for a resolution underlines the fact that the Council has limited itself to uttering fine words of condemnation and has not even taken part in the efforts aimed at negotiation which should bring an end to the hostilities .
as we know , it is the United States , Rwanda and the OAU which have intervened .
the Council &apos;s passiveness and lack of action in this matter are a scandalous reflection of the lack of a common foreign policy , as is the fact too that these two countries are neighbours , not only in terms of geography , but also in terms of ideology , history and , more recently , belligerence .
they are neighbours , yet a war is taking place between them , although for the moment it seems as if a cease @-@ fire has been achieved . it is one of those &quot; wars of the end of the world &apos; , to use the expression from an extraordinary book by the Peruvian @-@ Spanish writer Vargas Llosa , which you will surely have read , called &quot; The War of the End of the World &apos; in Brazil ; a terrible war which he skilfully described in novel form .
I believe that we cannot in future , or even at present , limit ourselves to offering fine words and even generous humanitarian aid . instead , it is essential that from this experience - which , after all , is relatively small in the general scale of things - we understand the consequences which must lead us , Mr President , to put an end to our lack of action and our passiveness .
Mr President , I too wanted to pay tribute to Mr Anastassopoulos &apos; work and make it clear that it is possible to admire a rapporteur &apos;s work , and congratulate him on it , without necessarily agreeing with all the points in the report .
I particularly agree with the way it gathers together all our national experience ; proposes a draft electoral procedure based on common principles , developing the Treaty of Amsterdam ; presents the principle of proportional representation as the most important ; and the incompatibility of mandates , especially those between the European Parliament and the national parliaments .
but although I agree with all that , and also the transnational dimension of the elections - although I know public opinion is against that in some countries - I have to say that I do not agree with the idea of territorial constituencies , and making them compulsory for countries with a population of over 20 million .
my first argument is that it is an arbitrary figure .
so in countries with a population of 19 million , if any existed , Members of the European Parliament elected in a single constituency would be close to the people , whereas in countries of 21 million inhabitants they are not , and have to be divided up into various constituencies , of approximately 5 or 6 million people .
I do not think such an arithmetical method will resolve the question of the citizens being close to their representatives .
secondly , there is an adverse effect on medium @-@ sized political options - not the People &apos;s Party , to which Mr Anastassopoulos belongs , or the Party of European Socialists .
political choices such as the one I represent , which count on approximately 10 % of European voters , and which are not nationalist parties , would really be placed in a very difficult situation .
in other words , the people we represent would be left with virtually no representatives .
that is an attack against the fundamental principle upheld by Mr Anastassopoulos : the principle of proportionality .
I believe we need to study what happens in real political life .
here , perhaps , the Conference of Presidents could be made up of just four group chairmen .
that is why , every now and then , the report says &quot; without violating the proportional system &apos; , &quot; without generally violating it &apos; , and so on , because the main objective is being compromised .
I must also say that in some countries there are worrying political consequences because not all regions are equal and not all territories have political power .
of the 200 European regions , only 69 have real regional parliaments . they have a different dimension , and in Member States with historical communities , with a political personality , it is very difficult to set up different constituencies with a very different dimension .
I will finish , Mr President , by saying that the constituency system in a country I greatly respect - Italy - has not exactly solved the problem of the people being close to their representatives , because political parties can also put forward the same candidates in all the constituencies , which is something this document does not address .
I am not sure that subsidiarity is being fully respected , and for all those reasons , if the rapporteur and Parliament do not accept any amendments then , regretfully , we shall not be able to vote in favour of this report , which contains such interesting elements .
the Council has proposed a joint action with regard to the methods of cooperation between Member States in the fight against organized crime .
we are delighted that this type of cooperation is being established at intergovernmental level , as it cannot fail to have a positive effect on the fight against international crime and will increase the efficiency of the police and the law in Member States .
on the other hand , the treatment of the Council &apos;s proposals by this Parliament &apos;s Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs is extremely worrying .
the committee has disfigured the Council &apos;s proposal , by systematically amending the provisions which ensure respect for national legislation and , therefore , the sovereignty of Member States .
it is certainly not the business of this Parliament to give an opinion on this type of issue , nor is it Parliament &apos;s business to recognize the competency of the European Court of Justice by means of Amendment No 13 to Article 4 .
the Court of Justice cannot be considered competent on this subject in any capacity . the Council &apos;s proposal adopts the principle of an intergovernmental procedure , which implies that Member States themselves are competent , by means of their respective legal systems , with regard to the interpretation of the joint action and the settlement of any disputes concerning its implementation .
it is impossible to envisage that , due to this joint action , persons under the Member States &apos; jurisdiction with whom they are understandably unlikely to agree , should be able to bring the Member States before the Court of Justice !
we are , therefore , totally opposed to the proposals of the Orlando report on principle and for practical reasons .
Elchlepp report ( A4 @-@ 0227 / 98 )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Commission , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Baldarelli , for the excellent report he has brought before us .
like Mr Baldarelli himself , we too recognise the importance of road transport telematics services in our common effort to make our roads safer , cleaner , more competitive and more effective .
telematics can serve individual citizens , vehicle fleet operators or indeed emergency service providers , and of course they can benefit public transport agencies , while at the same time creating opportunities on the labour market for our industries and helping to ensure a more efficient use of energy resources .
it was for all those reasons that the Commission drew up the communication we are debating today .
it provides a framework for the development of a broad range of telematics services and systems for road transport , in a flexible way so as to respond to both local and Community needs .
we also share the view that RTT services will only be more effective if they have been incorporated in transport strategies aimed at achieving specific policy aims - in other words , RTT is a tool to help in the implementation of political decisions .
the communication published in May last year identified some very specific actions for the sectors with first priority , and also indicated actions in other sectors .
most of the first @-@ priority actions have already been completed , as many Members will know from the excellent hearing held by the Committee on Transport and Tourism at the beginning of this year .
for example , we have already concluded memoranda of agreement in the RDS @-@ TMC sector for the radio broadcasting of data and road traffic messages and for the exchange of data , which have already been signed by the main players in these sectors .
as for the arrangements being made by the various bodies to put these memoranda into practice , they too have made significant progress .
alongside these arrangements , the situation is now developing through European regional projects and national projects financed by the budget for trans @-@ European transport networks .
and we have already started examining certain other sectors which Mr Baldarelli &apos;s report rightly regards as important , for example information before and during a journey , public transport and multimodal transport .
indeed , in the next few weeks we expect to be submitting a communication on interoperational systems for electronic fee collection in Europe .
the importance of European regional projects as a driving force for the development of RTT is also recognised in the report presented to Parliament .
these projects envisage the creation of RTT services in cross @-@ border regions and have already attracted the participation of 12 of the 15 Member States .
their contribution is of truly fundamental importance in securing the interoperability of RTT systems and the continuity of RTT services across the borders of these countries .
they presuppose the monitoring and management of traffic on the main arteries , including the formulation of new itineraries , information before the journey , information during the journey via message signal converters and the RDS @-@ TMC services .
this presupposes the cross @-@ border exchange of data between traffic monitoring centres .
in some projects , indeed , there is already cooperation in the sector of interoperational systems for electronic fee collection .
the Commission agrees that there is a need to establish standards at a high technical level for this sector , and for that reason it has commissioned the European Committee for Standardisation , the ECS , to carry out a project on matters which we regard as having particular priority for the achievement of our aims .
we asked the ECS to draw up a new working programme which would exactly reflect all those priorities .
indeed , given the global nature of RTT markets , we will also be examining , again in collaboration with the ECS , to what extent the arrangements for the cooperation of the ISO on common standards are satisfactory from the standpoint both of the aims of a transport policy and those of our industry .
it is clear that the security of RTT systems on vehicles must be of great concern to us all , and that is exactly why it has been included as a priority among our actions .
today , then , I am in the happy position of being able to tell you that an operational group set up by the Commission has drawn up a list of principles , and after consultation that list will undergo further refinement so as to give more accurate information about exactly what is required .
the Commission hopes to submit detailed proposals both to Parliament and to the Council on how this can be transformed into a self @-@ imposed memorandum of agreement , a code of practice with which manufacturers of equipment and motor vehicles , and those who assemble them , will have to comply .
at any rate , I can assure you that if the self @-@ imposed system we have proposed does not work , the Commission will not hesitate to submit new proposals for legislation in the sector .
finally , another concern which runs through Mr Baldarelli &apos;s report is that RTT must not be available only to a select group .
the Commission shares that view completely .
however , we will have to work closely with Parliament and the Member States to make sure of that .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am the last speaker this evening , but I do wish to use my two minutes and to thank you for staying with us .
what are we talking about this evening ?
we are talking about the support measures , about compensatory measures for our farmers in Europe .
the guarantee section of the EAGGF mainly finances expenditure in connection with the common agricultural market and pricing policies .
a large percentage of the fund is used for interventions to regulate the markets for agricultural produce .
in the 1996 financial year , the agricultural budget ran to ECU 40 828 million , which represents 50.5 % of the general EU budget .
we did have a rise in the agricultural guideline , precisely because the reform of the CAP , with the aforementioned new criteria , resulted in the aid available to the Member States being fully utilised for the first time , and because the European Union increased in size from 12 to 15 Member States on 1 January 1995 .
however , if we measure this rise against the increase in the general budget , we find that agricultural expenditure has declined by 1.2 % .
when it comes to dealing with public money , thrift is always a virtue , and expenditure must be seen in the light of the task in hand .
turning over the complex field of the common European agricultural policy requires adequate finances , and agriculture is the policy sector which is most comprehensively supported , and indeed monopolised , by the European Union .
besides compensatory support schemes for productive holdings , the European Union also provides accompanying measures which reflect its responsibility for the environment and for the victims of structural change .
these measures are important , and I welcome the proposals in this area , Commissioner , which you have made in the Agenda 2000 framework .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s call for greater transparency , and above all for the simplification of the complex application procedure .
we shall no doubt have ample opportunity here in Parliament to discuss the future shape of the EAGGF in the framework of Agenda 2000 , and I therefore take the view that points 11 and 12 do not belong in this report on the financial year 1996 .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , just before the summer recess , Commissioner , you presented your Youth 2000 @-@ 2004 programme .
we are glad to now have a comprehensive programme in which measures which target the same group are brought together .
this makes for greater coherence between the various measures , avoids a fragmentation of resources which are , after all , thin on the ground , and enables us to conduct a clearer policy .
we are keen to support you in that policy , as you can see today just a few months after you first presented your document .
as rapporteur , I have been concerned from the start to address the following points .
firstly , that this programme should reach as many young people as possible and above all those young people who have the greatest need for this kind of programme .
secondly , the programme should have a political dimension built into it . this programme must involve young people too in building the European Union by strengthening their notion of European citizenship .
your proposal , Commissioner , puts the main emphasis on young people &apos;s employability .
but the European Parliament wishes to broaden that objective and so make the programme more balanced .
I will just go through the amendments to your programmes which have in the meantime been submitted by the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Youth .
first and foremost an increase in the budget .
you propose ECU 600 million and we are asking for 800 million , because the amount has to show that Europe really is committed to investing in its younger generations and , moreover , we need that much in order to achieve the programme &apos;s ambitious objectives .
increasing the budget is one thing , but no less important to us is a redistribution of the funds .
because in your proposal , and do not take this the wrong way , Commissioner , the European Voluntary Service is strikingly predominant .
if we look at the figures , we see that two thirds of the monies under the whole programme are going directly or indirectly into the European Voluntary Service .
we are not for or against the European Voluntary Service , that is not the issue , but we can see that other programmes such as exchange projects or initiatives in favour of young people may be squeezed as a result .
that is why we wish to strike a balance , without creating any kind of panic , because the European Voluntary Service will always receive more money than the sums requested for it on Parliament &apos;s behalf in the past by Mrs Fontaine , who was rapporteur at the time .
we have a number of arguments in favour of that balance .
in your proposal , and we understand that , the references are almost exclusively to preparation for the world of work , entering the employment process , and social and vocational integration .
sadly , concepts such as European citizenship for young people , living together and inter @-@ cultural learning have been pushed into the background .
naturally we are convinced of the special importance of work to young people , but this target group is equally alert to things like the environment , law and order and the peaceful resolution of conflicts , European and international cooperation , and the position , rights and obligations of young people in society .
we also believe that this programme must provide an answer to phenomena such as individualism , nationalism , uncertainty , and lack of faith in others and in the future .
consequently we think the pillar of youth exchanges must be strengthened , especially since if we increase and redistribute the funds available , we can hopefully involve some one and a half million young people in the various measures and actions .
we have one or two more points to make .
we believe - and we looked at the experiment you tried with the CFO - that voluntary service must not replace paid jobs , and that beneficiary organisations must respect the European Union &apos;s rules in every particular .
fourthly , we think that the money must go primarily to those who need it most , and in our evaluation work we have found , from talking to young people and agencies on the spot , that it is those who know the situation best who are often best able to benefit from the funds available .
so we want to change things here , precisely for the benefit of those young people who invariably miss out .
lastly , we want more openness in evaluating projects , better publicity for programmes and a measure of flexibility in setting the age limits . Parliament &apos;s Committee on Youth was keen above all to listen to young people themselves and to the organisations which oversee the implementation of the programmes .
we were in touch with some 5 000 young people , and out of those contacts we distilled a report which had a multiple objective . one , to invest more money to enable more young people to be reached .
two , to achieve a balance between the various actions , stricter guidelines and better scrutiny to ensure that funds were being properly spent . three , to make access to and implementation of the programme more democratic and , lastly , to give young people better hopes for the future and at the same time to ensure more of a future for the project of building Europe by increasing the number of young people involved .
consumer protection has been the subject of several texts we have studied in recent months , notably the Kuhn and Roth @-@ Behrendt reports .
the amended directive that was presented to us yesterday also comes into this category although it includes , however , one regrettable exaggeration that I would like to highlight here .
the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE carried out a very productive investigation into a subject that was particularly delicate and likely to arouse highly conflicting passions .
we have been presented with the amendments proposed as if they follow on directly from this approach .
as a member of this Committee of Inquiry , I would like to protest against such excessive claims .
along with my colleagues , I have spent many months trying to ensure that measures were taken to help known victims and those yet to appear .
no directive on protection could be invoked .
it was therefore unthinkable to continue to ignore the damage suffered by consumers of agricultural products , whatever they may be , while all other manufactured products were covered by a directive .
for this reason , which in itself is positive , we are being presented with an extension of the directive that is totally unenforceable and unrealistic .
how can we restore the confidence of consumers if we propose , by way of protection , judicial procedures that will probably never reach a conclusion ?
how can we apply in practice the obligation on the producer to prove that he is not responsible for the damage reported by the consumer ?
with all due respect to Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt , it is not a matter of good consumers who are the injured parties on the one hand , and bad farmers who are thus the guilty parties on the other .
the circumstances surrounding the BSE crisis are difficult enough without making these kinds of categorisations .
the same is true when it comes to abolishing any time limit for establishing the liability of producers .
this is also totally inadmissible .
accepting such amendments opens the door to all kinds of excessive proposals and , in particular , to budgetary increases that are impossible to estimate .
I will therefore vote against all the amendments proposed by the Roth @-@ Behrendt report .
although they are based on a fair view of the situation of consumers of agricultural products , the solutions proposed are out of all proportion and require a great deal more thought and consultation with all the sectors involved .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we keep being accused of being remote from the citizens and aloof .
we can only defend ourselves against this accusation by ensuring greater transparency and democratic control .
the citizens of Europe have a right to that .
transparency and democratic control will bring us closer to the people , something we should not just think about every five years just before the elections .
much remains to be done .
that is apparent not just from Mrs Lööw &apos;s report .
it is apparent also from the 20 conclusions set out in my opinion , which the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights approved unanimously .
what I consider most important of all is to make improved access of the citizens to information the focal point of transparency .
in this regard , Finland and Sweden have developed an enviable culture of transparency .
we should take a leaf out of their book throughout the European Union .
in fact , why should we deny the people the widest possible access to our files and documents ?
what actually prevents us from widening this right and also giving it to Parliament &apos;s rapporteurs and others ?
why can the Council not work just as openly as the European Parliament to a large extent does ?
why do Council and Commission representatives have their own fixed seat in our committees , while Parliament does not in theirs , nor even its rapporteurs ?
but more transparency is not enough in itself if we want to come closer to the citizens .
in addition to making political procedures and decision @-@ making processes transparent , we must give the citizens a say .
the European Union institutions must develop mechanisms to enable the citizens to bring their own ideas and thoughts into the decision @-@ making process .
that is a basic requirement of democracy .
if we are to build the Europe of the future , we need the participation of all concerned , not least for the sake of our credibility .
Mr President , as is customary every year , the Commission &apos;s 27th report on competition policy provides a good picture of the Commission &apos;s thinking in this area and of its specific policy data .
flexible operation of the single market can only be achieved , certainly following the launch of the euro , if competition conditions are fair not only in law but also in fact , and if there really is equality of opportunities for all businesses .
the Commission &apos;s efforts to ensure that there is free competition within the single market are thus vitally important .
the Commission does good work here , and the fact that its decisions are not always palatable to those Member States which it is forced to reprimand in no way detracts from the value of that work .
I must compliment the rapporteur , Mrs Riis @-@ Jørgensen , on the work she has done .
I thank her for her fine and constructive cooperation , and all I can really say is that her report sets out what we in the PPE Group wished to say on the subject .
so I have nothing more to add , in point of fact .
I just have one question for the Commission , a very specific question .
last year , in June 1998 , the Court of Justice ruled in a case against Italy &apos;s National Council of Customs Agents that people in the professions are entrepreneurs like anyone else and are subject to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty .
I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether that ruling has implications for all the regulated professions .
the PPE Group &apos;s view is that account must be taken of the special role of certain professions in the general interest of society .
we should have liked to know the Commission &apos;s thinking on this .
I appreciate that I am rather springing this on the Commissioner .
I do not necessarily expect an answer here and now , but perhaps a written reply ?
forgive me , Commissioner , for not waiting to hear your answer now , but there is a group of 100 people waiting for me 50 kilometres away .
unfortunately , I have to leave the Chamber straight away .
Mr President , this report on the research agreement between the EU and Israel is no simple matter .
I can go along with part of what Mr Marset Campos said here , namely that this report , which we had thought would support the peace process , could just as easily be seen as a threat to that process if these issues are used to the wrong ends and in the political arena .
as far as the content of this agreement is concerned , those parts of the programme that relate to nuclear safety and fusion are , of course , excluded .
these areas are not included in this research agreement , a fact which I am pleased about .
at the same time , however , I am concerned , because we need to be aware of the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons , even though the country denies this .
I am a little anxious that , in spite of everything , funds will sneak in from other programmes precisely for use in research on nuclear fusion and nuclear activity .
this is something that I simply cannot support .
in this context , mention also needs to be made of Mordechai Vanunu , the Israeli researcher who disclosed details about nuclear weapons and nuclear energy research in Israel . it will soon be ten years since he was imprisoned .
it would now be appropriate for Israel to release him as quickly as possible .
there was an application for his release , but that has now been rejected .
I would like to ask Mrs Cresson what steps the Commission is taking to seek Mr Vanunu &apos;s release .
openness is perhaps not Commissioner Cresson &apos;s strong point , but I would nevertheless like to appeal for efforts to be made to prevail on Israel to release Mr Vanunu .
there are several other parts of this research project which I do not , perhaps , view as positively as the rapporteur does .
one such area is space research .
we Greens do not think that the EU should take part in space research .
we are therefore also against cooperation between the EU and Israel in this field . we are just as reluctant for such research to be conducted in the EU as we are for it to be conducted within the framework of agreements with other countries .
Mr President , let me begin by thanking Mr de Lassus for this highly significant report and the motion for a resolution .
I am delighted to note that Parliament agrees with the main thrust of our communication , and it should be appreciated that this is the first time we have tried to release the synergy between these two policies , as you have rightly been urging us to do , and to achieve closer coordination of our common research and development policy with our structural and cohesion policy .
we share your view that research , technological development , innovation and modernisation of the production basis are essential means of creating steady jobs and reducing regional disparities .
that is why , in the draft guidelines for the next structural programme , covering the period from 2000 to 2006 , which it adopted on 2 February , the Commission reaffirms the approach that is also clearly outlined in the present communication .
the competitiveness of a region is crucially dependent on whether or not it possesses an innovation strategy .
in the guidelines for the next period of the Structural Funds , the Commission therefore recommends to the regions a whole raft of measures designed to encourage innovation , from new forms of funding , such as venture capital to promote business start @-@ ups and innovative developments , to specialised services and facilities for technology transfer .
the contributions to the present debate have further emphasised the fact that the transfer of knowledge and know @-@ how and the dissemination of new techniques represent a vital contribution to the enhancement of regional competitiveness .
for that reason , the guidelines state that payments from the Structural Funds should primarily help small and medium @-@ sized businesses to acquire the skills they need in order to go on developing , but they should also be used to set up cooperative ventures and centres where knowledge and skills can be pooled and to fund involvement in Community and international research and innovation networks , not forgetting the business innovation centres and the various European networks through which we have already done a great deal to enable small and medium @-@ sized businesses to benefit from the results of research conducted by other bodies .
in response to your criticism of the fifth framework programme for research and technological development , let me say that this programme , as you know , was the result of two years of negotiation with Parliament and with the Member States , and that the framework programme is not primarily concerned with cohesion , but also focuses on the competitiveness of Europe as a global region in terms of leading @-@ edge technology , which naturally implies that one of its aims is to enable Europe to compete with the United States and Japan .
so the key point is that in pursuing the one aim , we do not neglect the other , and above all that we ensure not only that the development of research , particularly in the field of leading @-@ edge technology , benefits the poorer regions directly but also that exchanges of researchers , which will be supported under the fifth framework R &amp; D programme , can be used to promote innovation in the structurally weaker regions .
if you look at some of the elements of the fifth framework programme - at the development of human resources potential in the field of research , or at the improvement of the socio @-@ economic knowledge base - if you consider the Marie Curie homecoming grants for researchers from underprivileged regions and if you examine the development grants for research establishments in underdeveloped areas , you will see that the fifth framework programme responds to many of the needs of structurally weak regions and that its subject areas , such as the sustainable management of water supplies and water quality , sustainable agriculture , forestry and fisheries , rural areas , the town of tomorrow and the cultural heritage , are all of particular importance to regional development .
the same applies , of course , to objectives such as the promotion of innovation and the involvement of small and medium @-@ sized businesses .
as the rapporteur has already indicated , we have made progress over the last ten years , not least in terms of funding .
we started in 1988 with 200 million , and we now have 8.5 billion allocated to the Structural Funds for research and technology . it also has to be said here , of course , and I am grateful to Mr Hatzidakis for pointing this out too , that the Commission is not solely responsible , but that the Member States must also do more to ensure that such projects are included in their programmes .
in a recent Objective 1 evaluation , we observed that more money spent on research and innovation does not automatically mean more innovation .
in the cohesion countries in particular , the public sector is still largely overrepresented , while business innovations do not receive their fair share of funding , which is why I believe it is very important to put greater emphasis on the latter , because it is absolutely crucial that the regions themselves should be able to devise their own innovation strategies , which would be the best way to ensure that due account is taken of specific regional circumstances .
that is why initiatives such as the regional information society initiative , in which the regions cooperate - across national borders , incidentally - and exchange best practices in the field of innovation support , are so important .
that is why it is also important that the innovation dimension should become a more integral part of interregional and cross @-@ border cooperation .
Parliament and the Commission are , I believe , on the right path , but I agree with the rapporteur when he concludes that there is still a considerable way to go before we can say that the poorer regions have really started to bridge the gap in research and innovation , as well as in other areas .
Madam President , it is most regrettable that the Cox report is only now coming before the plenary again after being postponed for two months .
on the other hand , I am glad that Mr Cox &apos;s report has not lost too much of its force in the intervening period .
it still offers a clear alternative to the hybrid Commission proposal .
a large number of counter @-@ productive derogations have been scrapped , and I shall be glad to support the Cox report .
the Council must now make up its mind . either it sticks to the international agreements on limiting CO2 emissions and reducing environmental pollution or it opts for the unclear situation of the status quo , with further damage to our climate system as a result .
I am in favour of abolishing the exemption from tax for civil aviation fuel .
if the European Union unilaterally introduced a tax , however , this might lead to considerable distortion of aircraft movements .
I think an excellent alternative would be an overflying tax as advocated earlier , in conjunction with air traffic control services .
Mr President , this issue of the framework for informing and consulting employees is controversial .
it would be even more controversial if participation in the decision @-@ making process , which this House has already asserted in various resolutions as being the right of employees , were added to information and consultation .
in accordance with its well @-@ established practice , the Commission was in favour of the social partners establishing these rules themselves .
however , UNICE , the employers &apos; organisation at Community level , believes this issue falls within the principle of subsidiarity .
there were therefore no negotiations because the Commission was forced to present its proposal for a directive outside the social dialogue .
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was charged with drawing up an opinion on this report .
this task fell to me and my intention was to help make real progress in the direction previously taken by the European Parliament .
most members of this committee did not believe this to be the way forward and actually adopted UNICE &apos;s position .
no opinion was approved and the procedural page of the report states that the committee &apos; decided not to deliver an opinion &apos; .
this is to be regretted because this opinion would have contributed to the resolution which Parliament is going to adopt , whether my formulation was used or another one subject to more general agreement .
this is why I congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti on her work and her report .
if you will allow me , Mr President , I must say something briefly on another report on this area which came before this House today and which , due to Rule 52 , was not debated or voted on .
I am referring to the report on the organisation of work which must be regarded as a minor issue as it was rushed through Parliament .
how our priorities are distorted !
we voted on the monitoring of marine biotoxins and roll @-@ over stability , which are technical reports whose importance I do not deny , but we passed over the report on &apos; modernising the organisation of work - a positive approach to change &apos; . yet there are those who want the information , consultation and participation of employees to come under the principle of subsidiarity .
and then we complain about the public &apos;s lack of interest in the European Parliament !
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Prodi for saying so early in his introductory address that he is going to devote a great deal of thought to the issue of transparency and openness .
I should like to stress that in point of fact Parliament has taken many concrete decisions on what the concept of openness and transparency involves .
I am firmly convinced that Parliament will not retreat from the position it has already adopted .
in my view , it is to some extent a question of turning the principle of possibly being open when forced to be so into one of seeking to be as open as possible from the start .
moreover , it is not just a matter of providing information about the institutions &apos; own situation , but of supplying documents and answering the questions which people ask .
I believe that it will require a much sturdier framework and more rigorous staff training .
consequently , it will demand a great deal of effort ; it is not enough simply to say that we would like greater openness .
however , I am holding fast to Mr Prodi &apos;s commitment in this respect and I also hope that he understands that a great deal of effort will be needed as well , in order to achieve results .
Mr President , at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents this afternoon , we agreed to try to arrange the voting so that there was a clear vote showing who wanted to clean things up and who did not .
the secretaries @-@ general will now meet tomorrow morning to organise the voting .
my starting @-@ point in the Europe of Nations group is that we will vote in favour of the Council &apos;s draft Statute , even though in principle we are strong opponents of turning Members of Parliament into EU officials .
a common statute turns us into the EU &apos;s representatives in the Member States instead of the countries &apos; representatives in the EU .
in principle , we want to be paid the same as members of the national parliaments and to pay tax like the members of the public who vote for us .
if we nonetheless feel able to vote for the Council &apos;s proposal , it is because in practice a majority of those here in Parliament want to continue claiming EUR 1 000 for a journey costing EUR 400 , for example , and we give higher priority to cleaning up travel payments than to our objection in principle to common salaries and conditions of employment , and here we would particularly emphasise the fact there will be the possibility of taxing EU salaries nationally .
in the circumstances , the proposal which the Council has arrived at is a good one , and we recommend the Council to reach corresponding rules for the appointment of the new Commission and new civil servants in the institutions .
the counter @-@ argument that there should be equal pay for equal work is not feasible when it comes to international cooperation .
the Council &apos;s members would then have the same salary , staff at the EU countries &apos; embassies would have a uniform salary and experts would have the same , regardless of whether they represent agricultural organisations from a poor or a rich country .
equal pay is a nice principle , but the countries are not yet the same , and at the moment it is more important to get rid of Parliament &apos;s wastefulness .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , I should first of all like to point to the numerous advantages which the distance marketing of financial services can offer .
using the Internet , the provider can offer his services to clients across national borders without extra cost , and the consumer , without moving from his chair , can compare the services of different providers in both his own country and in others .
convinced of these benefits of distance selling , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted by 42 to 2 in favour of the following position .
above all , we are in favour of total harmonisation .
if we want a real single market for financial services , consumers and providers must be guaranteed the same rights everywhere in the Union .
we feel that a formal cooling @-@ off period puts unnecessary pressure on the consumer to make a decision within 14 days .
it is enough for the provider to state clearly how long his offer will remain open .
the committee also favours a conditional period of 14 days during which the contract may be cancelled .
and lastly , we believe that the consumer should be provided , at the time of the negotiation , with all the information he needs to evaluate the offer .
we do not think it is a good thing to hand over the completed contract at this stage .
this position closely reflects the original , balanced report of Mrs Oomen , who has indeed done an excellent job .
while the Environment Committee has approved a number of proposals aimed at significantly tightening up consumer protection , I do not believe that this goal will be achieved with a minimum directive , a 30 @-@ day cancellation period and the exchange at the time of negotiation of a full and legally complex contract plus a summary .
proposals of this kind will merely discourage people from buying and selling services via the Internet , by fax and by post .
moreover , we wish to ensure that the consumer who makes a bank transfer or concludes a contract of insurance face to face and not by remote methods is not at any time less protected .
on behalf of my group , I am therefore retabling a number of proposals by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , in a slightly amended form , and I would commend these to the House .
Mr President , I support the report by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , even though our admired rapporteur does not fully agree with its content . however , I also have a number of comments to make regarding several of the points raised because everything is open to debate and can be improved upon .
I shall refer to three amendments .
I shall firstly refer to Amendment No 21 to Article 3 .
the right of reflection in my view should be abolished where there is sufficient information . what is more , the reference to the principle of good faith in commercial transactions is a timely one that can be related to the oldest and most unique example of good faith in civil law .
however , the article contains a somewhat bland , if not dangerous , reference to minors . this is because minors are obviously protected by civil law not only in the part of the transaction based on honesty and good faith , but also because in civil law any transaction will be declared null and void if minors are not old enough according to the category of goods and transactions in question .
with regard to the other amendment , the famous Amendment No 22 to Article 4 on the right of withdrawal , I am also in favour of extending the 30 @-@ day withdrawal period for some contracts , for instance the high @-@ risk contracts such as life insurance and pensions .
the reference to mortgage contracts must also be qualified because , here again , we must bear in mind that 11 or 12 of the Member States give better mortgage credit protection through deeds and registration at a land registry , so it must be stressed that this text refers to a precontractual phase .
according to the majority of Member States &apos; legislation , there can be no contract without deeds and registration .
therefore , given that here the form is ad substantiam , it is not possible to talk in terms of mortgages , contracts or even credit .
lastly , I welcome the reference made to credit cards , because they have certainly been the subject of widespread abuse . in my view , the amendment relating to them , Amendment No 25 , should be stringently applied since they are commonly abused through the use of the card number alone without a signature .
Madam President , I too have a request , to thank the city of Strasbourg and the French government for making this building available to us .
for , in spite of the teething troubles , which are perfectly natural , it is a wonderful building and a worthy setting for the European Parliament here in Strasbourg .
I would also like to thank you , Madam President , for taking the initiative in helping to cope with these teething troubles .
I would like to mention one problem , one I hope is not mine alone .
this is the limited number of exits from , and entrances into , this Chamber .
you are familiar with the behaviour of the Members of Parliament .
generally , we all leave the chamber together or all enter it together before votes .
we keep getting queues of people in the aisles .
this is related to the fact that two access points are simply too few for the large number of Members of Parliament .
I do not know whether it is technically possible to additionally open one of these privileged access points for the Members of Parliament .
there is also a problem in that both the main exits lead to the foyer , which is extremely narrow .
the bridges are there .
the cameras are waiting there .
we Members of Parliament are also , by nature , very undisciplined and chat in the aisle , or stand right in front of the exits and talk to each other .
we could certainly also improve our discipline .
but I think we should have thought of something to make better use of the broad foyers located at the sides of this Chamber .
if we should come out there , we ought also to have the opportunity to sit down together somewhere other than in this enormous telephone kiosk .
I think serious precautions should be taken in the interests of safety , for what if an alarm were to go off ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the three draft reports we have before us concerning further financial assistance to Bulgaria , Romania and Macedonia cover much the same ground in terms of content and political perspective so I should like to explain them together .
what are they about ?
the Commission proposes granting loans to help the balance of payments in the context of a macro @-@ economic stabilisation programme drawn up by the International Monetary Fund .
it is intended to grant a sum of EUR 100 million to Bulgaria and a sum of EUR 200 million to Romania , in each case as a long @-@ term loan .
in the case of Macedonia , a contribution of no more than EUR 30 million in addition to the euro loan of EUR 50 million has been proposed because the country &apos; s financial position has been particularly exacerbated by the conflict in Kosovo .
in the case of all the countries , the financial assistance is to be provided in two tranches with the second tranche only being released once economic development and reforms have been satisfactorily resumed .
the amounts I have mentioned for the various States are proportionate , on the one hand , to the estimated deficits in the balance of payments of the individual countries and , on the other hand , to the multilaterally agreed share which the EU has to contribute to these forms of macro @-@ economic financial assistance .
we are therefore concerned here with comparatively modest amounts .
just to support the balance of payments of the six States bordering Kosovo , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have estimated that USD 1.5 billion in financing is required .
let me briefly go into details about the three countries which we are now dealing with here .
for Macedonia , an external financial shortfall to the tune of USD 372 million is expected in 1999 .
financial assistance is therefore an urgent matter in view of the vital interests which Europe has in stability in the Balkans .
the dramatic reports may have disappeared from the television screens , but there are still thousands of Kosovan refugees in Macedonia .
with the economic development since the change of government in 1997 , Bulgaria has made some remarkable progress .
economic growth has been stimulated again .
the rate of inflation has fallen .
exports have increased and direct foreign investments have been noted .
however , the balance of payments deteriorated in 1998 , with the crisis in Russia being partly responsible for this .
in Bulgaria &apos; s balance of payments for 1999 , a financial shortfall of approximately USD 500 million is anticipated .
without the balance of payments loan of a maximum of EUR 100 million proposed by the Commission , the Bulgarian reform programme might be placed in jeopardy .
aid from the EU might also make it easier for Bulgaria to make some progress with safety at its nuclear power plants . this is also a matter of some concern for my home country , Austria .
because of the conflict in Kosovo , foreign trade has further deteriorated in Romania .
an additional balance of payments deficit amounting to USD 190 million is in the offing .
here too , the laborious process of economic reform must be continued with and supported .
in order to make further progress , Bulgaria , Romania and Macedonia need our help .
the planned financial aid which , in the first place , is really a technical process , is also politically significant in connection with the discussion about enlargement of the European Union and , above all , against the background of the destabilisation of South @-@ East Europe because of the Kosovo conflict .
my own homeland , Austria , borders on four countries which want to join the European Union .
it , therefore , has a particular interest in the economic and also political stabilisation of Central and South @-@ East Europe .
such stabilisation cannot be achieved unless the region makes its own contribution .
how much would growing uncertainty in Central and Eastern Europe cost in terms of political and financial capital ?
in the end , how much would it cost us to look on and do nothing ?
we must therefore commit ourselves , and not only financially but also politically .
the Group of the Party of European Socialists last week lent its support in Skopje to the idea of a Stability Pact in South @-@ East Europe and , above all , took up the themes of democracy , human rights and a civilian society .
strengthening civilian society is undoubtedly an important concern but is inconceivable without stable framework conditions for the various national economies .
I therefore recommend approval of the Commission &apos; s proposals for financial assistance , including the amendments included in the report .
my amendments to the Commission &apos; s document are a reminder of the goal of macro @-@ economic stabilisation .
what , however , we must be concerned with , above all , is securing long @-@ term employment and improving the conditions of people &apos; s lives in the countries affected .
in this context , the IMF &apos; s policy of economic restructuring is often cause for fierce and necessary criticism .
in the end , programmes in South @-@ East Asia and particularly in Indonesia were to the detriment of poor strata of the population when , for example , subsidies for basic foodstuffs were cancelled .
in the case of the economic reforms which are on the agenda in the former socialist States , a situation must therefore be prevented in which the burdens of change again affect those in society who are least able to defend themselves .
it is true that the IMF has improved in many respects , but there is still a great deal of work to be done .
accordingly , we are also arguing for having representatives of the programmes join us here in Parliament , or at least in the Committees .
with my changes , I should also like , however , to go on emphasising that the Commission and the relevant States are obliged to comply with the rules for budget supervision and efficient administration .
it must go without saying that the European Parliament will be informed appropriately and in good time about any payments made and about the ways in which these are used .
finally , steps must be taken to ensure that the macro @-@ economic financial assistance is not misappropriated , as we have seen happen in a dramatic way in Russia .
the Council has requested urgent procedure in connection with the financial aid to these three countries .
this means that we must approve them this week here in Strasbourg .
in commenting upon this , the Committee on Budgets pointed out the basic interinstitutional problems and problems relating to budget policy which would arise if we were to comply with the Council &apos; s request for urgent procedure in the case of financial assistance for Macedonia , since in this case , the Commission &apos; s proposal contains a subsidy component .
granting up to EUR 30 million in subsidies to Macedonia throws up budgetary problems of a technical nature .
the funds specified in Category 4 , &quot; External Actions , &quot; of the Financial Perspective have already been exhausted by the funds assigned in the draft EU budget .
the European Parliament must therefore insist upon a corresponding review of the Financial Perspective as a prior condition for granting the subsidy .
overall , there ought , however , to be agreement about the fact that aid is quickly needed for Bulgaria , Romania and Macedonia .
Mr President , with Nelson Mandela &apos; s farewell as President and the election of Thabo Mbeki , South Africa entered a new political era .
as one young South African who had grown up in Denmark expressed it , &quot; it is good for South Africa now that Mandela is retiring . &quot;
it is not good for a democracy to have a god as President , and Mandela was and remains a deity .
but you do not rebel against gods , not in any case when they have just opened the way to freedom .
by this , I do not mean that Thabo Mbeki does not have god @-@ like characteristics . what I mean is that the patience shown by the poor towards Nelson Mandela will not be shown towards Thabo Mbeki .
they are making demands here and now for food , housing , education , that is to say , all the things which we in the western world take for granted .
for the time being , they remain only criminals . subsequently , they will rise in rebellion .
this puts Thabo Mbeki in a quite different situation from his predecessor , but it also puts us in the EU in a quite different situation .
we should remember this fact and we should also remember the Balkans and what Kofi Annan said in his speech to the UN at the opening of the General Assembly this year : that it is incredible how much we sacrifice to go to war and how little we sacrifice to prevent war .
that is why it is good that we have obtained the present agreement between South Africa and the EU .
it is certainly not as good as it ought to be .
it is not nearly generous enough , and I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Kinnock , for pointing this out . nonetheless , it is there and it binds the EU and South Africa together .
hopefully , it will mean that , in South Africa too , it is felt that it is no longer so very far from the EU to South Africa , either physically or psychologically , and that the gap between words and action is no longer so lengthy as , without a shadow of a doubt , it was felt to be in the period after 1994 and up until 1999 .
as an MEP for London , I am glad to represent many Turks , Turkish Cypriots and Kurds .
that leads me to insist that the chief obstacle to Turkey &apos; s accession is not prejudice or discrimination .
the EU is not a Christian club .
Europe is culturally richer for having Muslim citizens and residents , and I welcome that .
the chief obstacle to Turkey &apos; s entry is its inability to meet the political criteria laid down at Copenhagen , especially regarding democracy , human rights and the rights of minorities , especially the Kurdish people .
and it is patronising and insulting to treat Turkey differently from other candidates as if suggesting Turkey is second class and incapable of aspiring to European political standards .
the main cancer in the Turkish system is the repression of the Kurdish people .
this has distorted the Turkish State and justified its militarisation .
hundreds of thousands of people have died and millions have been evicted from their homes .
the PKK has committed some atrocities but these have been far outweighed by those perpetrated by the Turkish army .
there is insufficient response to the PKK &apos; s ceasefire .
our mistake is to perceive Turkey more as a strategic military ally than as a political partner .
we must intensify our relationship and contribute to constructive change , but must not say yet that Turkey is on track to join .
that is why I cannot support my own Group &apos; s Amendment 1 .
Mr President , I too would like to voice my appreciation of the rapporteur &apos; s excellent work carried out in difficult conditions on a difficult subject .
two circumstances have shown us that this is a difficult matter : an almost unanimous joint agreement on the urgency and importance of adopting efficient policies to combat unemployment and for this to happen within a framework where the necessary support for a positive economic process will safeguard social cohesion and the European social model .
that the conditions are complicated is shown by the way our agreement on these objectives often runs the risk of collapsing when it comes to establishing the solutions and strategies for action .
I will therefore concentrate on the things that I believe can be strengthened in the future and which can form one of the elements to be discussed in our debate .
firstly , I think that , as regards supply policies to boost employment , our intervention , the joint intervention of the Community institutions of the Member States , is important but it is not enough . I think there is insufficient coordination between the policies on labour , employment , and managing the job market and the policies which affect structural factors and in the macro @-@ economic framework .
there is an insufficient level of structuring and investment in efficient Community institutions capable of managing these processes where it is not enough just to respect the competences and the prerogatives of the national States .
regarding this matter , I would mention only one problem for the Members who , on the other hand , always show this sensitivity in particular . we consider unemployment to be an evil to combat , certainly not a circumstance to exploit even in the competition between countries &apos; economic systems and production systems for instrumental competition based on social dumping .
I have never fully understood what is meant when reference is made to a job with a social content but , on the other hand , I definitely do know that a perspective of increasing employment by reducing the fundamental safeguards and fundamental objectives of social cohesion is not possible .
finally , as regards active policies on the job market , training and retraining , all important guidelines , I think the level of consensus is insufficient , even on credible gauges of the effectiveness of these policies within national plans on employment , with regard to which the whole range of Community Institutions is , in any case , committed to assessing the successes and results .
when we abandon compensatory policies and passive polices in favour of active policies , we cannot be satisfied by a casual use of words . what counts in gaining qualifications , training and retraining is action .
when talking about the suffering of millions of people , statistics are often deceptive .
we cannot allow them to be used as drunkards sometimes use lampposts - as support when they are unsteady , instead of to light up the way forwards .
Mr President , it is a fact that this disgraceful law , known as the Helms @-@ Burton Act , has had catastrophic consequences both for socialist Cuba and its people , and for humanity as a whole .
not only does it seek to subjugate a proud race which insists on its right to self @-@ determination ; it also signals the wish on the part of the American imperialists , manifested on numerous occasions , to impose their will and their laws on the international economy , on international trade and on international business .
this is why the Helms @-@ Burton Act has met and continues to meet with general disapproval and demands for its immediate repeal , and rightly so .
what worries me is that the request for European undertakings to be exempted from the scope of this criminal legislation , however beneficial this may in fact be to European undertakings , fails to solve the problem .
in essence , it is tantamount to acknowledgement of the Act , thereby detracting from the very pressure which we are exerting for its repeal .
do you not think , Commissioner , that the European Union should exert all its influence , using every means imaginable , to bring about the immediate repeal of this unacceptable Act , rather than confining itself to statements .
Mr Solana , we have recently witnessed a meeting between Castro and the Spanish leadership and we are all aware of the position of the United States of America .
I would also conjecture that a leader of a European country went to Belgrade to see Milosevic .
what would your comments be on these two events ?
I am raising this issue not to make things difficult for you , because we do not carry out foreign policy based on conjecture , but to illustrate the context in which you should operate .
you must not walk on a tightrope because , as we all know , tightrope @-@ walkers are doomed to fall one day .
there are two strategies before us .
the first is for preventing tension and the second is for managing tension and crises whenever they arise .
the latter involves a Europe which is politically absent but economically present ; it is a strategy for simply monitoring crises , which leads nowhere .
the former is a strategy for Europe and for peace , security and economic development .
fifty years on , we once again witnessed war on Europe &apos; s doorstep with the recent crisis in Yugoslavia .
it was a mistake with indeterminable repercussions .
now we are confronted with a new phase of developments and hostilities in the Caucasus region .
I believe that there is a golden opportunity for you now in the Caucasus to prove yourself as a true Prometheus and not an Epimetheus .
you are probably familiar with the Ancient Greek tragedies of Aeschylus and the story &quot; Prometheus Bound &quot; which took place in the Caucasus region where Zeus punished Prometheus and tied him up in chains as punishment for stealing fire from the thunderbolt and giving it to Man .
I hope , Mr Solana , that you will , in any case , be a Prometheus , both in the Caucasus and in your forthcoming term of office , as that will serve the interests of Europe , of democracy and of human rights .
once again , I wish you every success .
Mr President , the commitment of the European Union , repeated in the Schwaiger report , to the creation of a permanent labour forum between the International Labour Organisation and the World Trade Organisation on issues related to trade , globalisation and labour is the only way to accompany the liberalisation of commerce and trade in general with respect for fundamental labour rights , without slipping into egotistical , hypocritical protectionism or unfair , self @-@ destructive competition .
in this respect , the bilateral agreement that the United States has signed with China to prepare the way for China to join the World Trade Organisation must be regarded by the European Union , aside from as an important contribution to the multilateral process , also , and above all , as a fundamental opportunity to monitor the substantial importance that human rights have and will have regarding the opportunities afforded by a market that enjoys such enormous potential as the Chinese market .
let us remember , in this regard , that the 174 member countries of the ILO which , with the solemn declaration of 1998 , undertook to comply with the four categories of fundamental labour rights , even where they did not ratify the conventions , are , in the main , also members of the WTO .
now , since the international bodies are what the Member States want them to be , it is legitimate to ask these same States to behave in a consistent manner throughout the fora .
the desirable entry of China , which the European Union is also actively negotiating for , will certainly make the WTO more representative and will extend the potential ability to realise global free trade that is also regulated .
nevertheless , that does not mean deluding ourselves that many of the problems regarding fundamental rights in China have now been resolved or are being resolved , nor ignoring the fact that , in the past , the United States itself has had double standards regarding the request for the social clause to be complied with .
it is , however , better that it is possible for the attempt to affirm these rights to be made within the walls of the international institutions , rather than in bilateral fora , according to what is convenient at the time .
Mr President , I shall take the statements that I must answer in order , first on the subject of Rwanda , then Burundi .
as far as Rwanda is concerned , the Commission shares the concerns which have been expressed regarding the effectiveness of the system of justice , if I may use this diplomatic term , to judge those responsible for genocide .
no national reconciliation is possible without proper court procedures , and that involves both the Rwandan national justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda .
to answer Mrs Ries , regarding the Rwandan national system of justice , the Commission targeted its interventions at institutional support to the government departments in the area of reinforcement of defence rights and civil cases , in the area of improving living standards in prisons and in the area of support for the survivors of genocide , as well as in the area of respect for human rights .
nonetheless , there are still 130,000 prisoners in prison , accused of crimes related to genocide , awaiting trial .
the Rwandan Government is looking for alternative formulae which do not leave room for impunity , and which go in the direction we would like .
it is working on defining a system of courts of arbitration along the lines of traditional practice , where the courts are made up of citizens elected to the various levels of local administration , and they would be established to judge three categories of defendant : firstly , ordinary murderers , secondly , those who assaulted but did not kill , and thirdly , finally , the looters , leaving the instigators and ideologists of the genocide and massacres to be judged effectively by ordinary courts , which must be organised in some way to be able to take on this task .
with the other backers , the Commission is currently assessing the opportunities and methods to contribute to the establishment of this system within the framework of our cooperation .
as far as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is concerned , the Commission allocated finance from the very creation of this tribunal , totalling EUR 1.5 million to date .
the Commission is going to initiate an evaluation of human rights programmes in developing countries .
particular attention will be paid to the countries or projects we have supported , such as the one I have just mentioned .
this evaluation will include support for the International Criminal Tribunal and its conclusions will enable us to identify any new support according to the methods we shall assess in the light of this investigation .
as far as Burundi is concerned , we , too , are extremely concerned at the situation of increasing violence in this country .
what are we doing in response to this ?
I know and I can see that it is always ridiculous to cite aid figures in the face of such calamities .
I nonetheless believe that these are the only real proof we can offer to show what we are doing to act on these concerns of yours .
the real criticism you might make , which would hit home , is that we are passive in this type of situation .
I believe we are not being passive in this particular instance .
I should like to give you some examples of this .
we have supported the peace process by financing the talks taking place in Arusha , with a contribution of EUR 2 million , which is far from being the largest contribution and which should , along with other external finance , be sufficient for the successful conclusion of these talks .
it is true that the passing of the facilitator , ex @-@ President Nyerere , is one more obstacle to add to the complexity of the process itself .
we think that it is essential for the talks to continue while seeking a new facilitator at the same time .
the intensification of the confrontations , in recent months , has given rise to the displacement of some tens of thousands of people who have , in effect , as has been mentioned in this debate , been forcibly detained in camps by the government since last July .
we intervened immediately to provide humanitarian aid , with aid of more than EUR one million over three operations , and we are prepared to continue to intervene in order to meet the most urgent needs next year .
the total ECHO contribution to Burundi reached around EUR 10 million this year .
at a meeting in New York at the start of the year , the backers of Burundi decided to contribute towards improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable sectors of the population and to target their support at the rehousing of displaced persons .
in the context of these positions , the Commission approved a redevelopment programme of around EUR 50 million , which may be implemented according to the security conditions in the country .
we feel that the complete resumption of cooperation is linked to the results of the peace process , and to the establishment of a political and constitutional framework which will lead , finally , to democratisation .
this is the answer which I wished to give you , Mr President .
this report was adopted in committee by an overwhelming majority of 47 to 1 without amendment .
it concerns a small but important modification of an existing directive which needs to be implemented before the end of this year in order to prevent many European companies from being in breach from January onwards .
the Finnish Presidency would very much like to adopt this proposal in Council this week .
the last meeting of the Council this year is on Thursday and , if the House wills it and is agreeable , I would like to make a formal proposal that , instead of a debate , we have a vote on the report on Wednesday .
this would enable the Council to go through its procedures very swiftly and make a lot of European industries happy .
I understand that it would be something of a first to achieve agreement with unanimity in the Council on the first reading .
I should therefore like to propose a vote without debate on Wednesday .
